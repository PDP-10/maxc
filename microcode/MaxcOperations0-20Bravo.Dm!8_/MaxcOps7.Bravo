STOPPING TENEXx36e12c\bIn order to give users adequate notice and to protect files on disk, Tenex should ordinarily be stopped in the following manner.	x3e12jAs long as possible before the scheduled downtime (preferably 24 hours or more), notify users by (optionally) putting a notice in the login message, setting the system downtime cell, and recording a telephone message.	x3e12jA.	To put a notice in the login message,1 login as yourself and:x3e12\40f1o4 1f0o0	@SNDMSG <cr>	To: SYSTEM <cr>	cc: <cr>	Subject: Scheduled downtime <cr>	Message:	(An appropriate message giving date, time, and reason)	^Z	Q,S,?,carriage-return: <cr>	SYSTEM -- ok	@x3e12(0,5080)\2u11U6u11U6u4U11u23U68u2U25u4U------------------------------1Do this only if the downtime is of unusual nature or duration.  You must be a member of the "System" group to send messages to SYSTEM.y126x2e3(635)\31f1o4 1o0x3e12B.	To set the system downtime cell, you must be a wheel or a maintenance person:x3e12	@ENABLE <cr>     (only if you are a wheel)	!HALT, <cr>        (do not omit the comma)	[Superpassword:] GUESS <cr>	!!AT mm/dd/yy hh:mm <cr>	    (date&time system going down)	!!UNTIL mm/dd/yy hh:mm <cr>	         (date&time coming back up)	!!DUE (TO REASON) reason (type ? for list) <cr>	!!<cr>	!x3e12(0,5080)(1,13462)\2u11U6i4I14i5I4u10U12i3I35u10U4u22U38u25U40u22U19u4U4u4UC.	To record a telephone message, go to the recording telephone (next to the Imp in the back room) and follow the instructions posted there.	x3e12j(635)The system will automatically start notifying users of the impending downtime beginning one hour before it is to occur.  When the zero hour arrives, all jobs will be forcibly logged out except any job logged in on the Maxc controlling terminal, new logins will be prevented, and "Shutdown Complete" will type out on the Maxc console.  If there are now no jobs logged in, Tenex will shortly hit a BUGCHK (EDDT breakpoint) at SWHLT1, at which point Tenex is properly halted.x3e12jIf there is a job logged in on the Maxc controlling terminal, it will be necessary to halt Tenex manually.  To do this (for which you must be a wheel):	x3e12j\144i5I	@ENABLE <cr>	!QUIT <cr>	.Halt Tenex.x3e12k80\2u11U3u9U3u1U9u1UWait for the EDDT breakpoint at SWHLT1.  A message such as "$8B>>CHKADR BUGCHK/ SWHLT1" should be printed out.  At this point it is safe to un-protect the AltIO console ("3301P") and return control to Midas ("M").	x3e12jIf you only wish to move cables or disk controllers, etc., then you may do it at this point.  As long as nothing you've done has glitched the system in any way then you may resume from the service interruption by typing to EDDT: <esc>P.	x3e12jIf what you did has glitched the system then it will not resume cleanly, and you now have to "soft-restart" Tenex as follows:		Select menu items "AltIO", "Dont-Go", "Do-It".  Then type:		:140Go [confirm[.	x3e12j\191u4U11u1Ux3e12j
