LOADING THE PDP-10 EMULATORy684x3e2c(635)\b31BAssuming system power has been turned on and the Alto is at command level (Alto Executive), one may load the microcode and start Tenex by means of the single command:e12j	MIDAS TENGO<cr>e12j(0,3810)(1,65535)Midas will run through the TENGO command file which loads the microcode, displays some junk on the screen, and starts up Tenex.  This takes about a minute.	e12j(635)After loading the microprocessor, TENGO resets the machine (21;G) and checks the microcode (25;G).  The microprocessor may crash (IMA=20) if there were any failures detected during loading.  LM 10 will contain the address of the incorrect word (if only one word was clobbered).1  Note the values of LM 10 and IMA in the log and call system maintainers if the microprocessor crashes.  If you cannot get the system maintainers, get out of Midas (by selecting "Exit" with the mouse) and repeat MIDAS TENGO, since hardware flakiness has been known to cause loads to fail spuriously and you may be lucky on the second try.	e12j\277f1o4 1f0o0If the load succeeds, AltIO is started, which in turn boots in Micro-Exec from one of the Maxc disks.  The following message is printed out on the Maxc console:	e12j	Micro-Exec, Ver <version identifying string>		*e12j(0,5080)Micro-Exec immediately executes an automatic "Go" command, which causes Tenex to be loaded from disk and started.  Further procedures are described in the next section.	e12j(635)If it is desired to load the microcode without starting AltIO or Micro-Exec, use the TENLOAD command file instead of TENGO;  i.e. type:	e12j	MIDAS TENLOAD <cr>	e12j(0,5080)TENLOAD is identical to TENGO except that it does not start AltIO, Micro-Exec, or Tenex, but rather leaves control in Midas.	e12j(635)To start AltIO and boot in Micro-Exec (without starting Tenex), select "AltIO", "Boot-MExec", and "Do-It" with the mouse.	e12jThe MEXECGO command file combines the effect of TENLOAD followed by starting AltIO and booting in Micro-Exec.	e12jNote:  The above procedure only works when Micro-Exec is on save area 1 of disk unit A.  This is normally the case.  However, during periods when disk controllers are being checked out or when there has been hardware flakiness with disk controllers, MEXEC may not be on unit A.  In this case it is probably on another disk drive.  You should follow the procedure discussed in  "Calling AltIO" in order to boot Micro-Exec from another drive.	e12j\i5I------------------------------1Checker failure interpretation is discussed in more detail in section 11.\f1 31o4 1o0
