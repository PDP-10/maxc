Prior to Shutdowny720x6e36k792(635)\f5bIn order to give users adequate notice and to protect files on disk, Tenex should ordinarily be stopped in the following manner.	d3705x6e10jk40	Forty-eight hours prior to the scheduled power outage send a message to the NCC Coordinator and the Arpanet liaison at SCI via their Arpanet mailboxes CONTROL@BBNC and Green@SCI-ICS stating the period the power will be off and that the IMP will be affected.  If the scheduled power outage is to take place in less than 48 hours then the NCC Coordinator may be reached direct by phone: (617) 661-0100.  The controller may wish you to call him just prior to taking the system down so you can set some switches on the IMP panel.		As long as possible before the scheduled downtime (preferably 24 hours or more), notify users by (optionally) putting a notice in the login message, setting the system downtime cell and recording a telephone message.  Make sure you do these things on the correct Maxc system!	x6e10jk40\748bi57BIA.	To put a notice in the login message, login as yourself and:	x6e10jk40@SNDMSG<cr>To: SYSTEM<cr>cc:<cr>Subject: Scheduled downtime<cr>	Message:(An appropriate message giving date, time, and reason)	^ZQ,S,?,carriage-return:<cr>SYSTEM -- ok	@l5468x6e10jk40\1u10U5u10U4u4U10u22U67u2U23u4UB.	To set the system downtime cell, you must be a wheel or a maintenance person:	x6e10jk40@ENABLE<cr>		(only if you are a wheel)	!HALT,<cr>		(do not omit the comma)	[Superpassword:]GUESS<cr>@@AT mm/dd/yy/ hh:mm<cr>					(date & time system going down)@@UNTIL mm/dd/yy hh:mm<cr>					(date & time coming back up)@@DUE (TO REASON) reason (type ? for list)<cr>	@@<cr>@l5468x6e10jk40\1u10U3i4I14i5I4u9U6i3I34u9U3u22U39u24U36u22U18u4U4u4UC.	To record a telephone message, go to the recording telephone (next to the Imp in the back room) and follow the instructions posted there.  Make sure you specify Maxc1 or Maxc2 in the message.x6e10jk402.  System Shutdown	x6e12jk40\f5b19f0B	General Methodology:			(1) Shut down software systems cleanly			(2) Safeguard rotary storage by spinning down all disk drives			(3) Get all other power off in the simplest manner possible so that restart can be accomplished		    without an excessive current surge.	x6e12jk40\1i20I1i41I1i64I1i140I	Maxc 1 & 2	x6e12jk40\b11BThe systems will automatically start notifying users of the impending downtime beginning one hour before it is to occur.  When the zero hour arrives, all jobs will be forcibly logged out except any job logged in on the Maxc controlling terminal, new logins will be prevented, and "Shutdown Complete" will type out on the Maxc console.  If there are now no jobs logged in, Tenex will shortly hit a BUGCHK (EDDT breakpoint) at SWHLT1, at which point Tenex is properly halted.	l5468x6e6jk40If there is a job logged in on the Maxc controlling terminal, it will be necesary to halt Tenex manually.  To do this (for which you must be a wheel):	l5468x6e6jk40\143i5I@ENABLE<cr>!QUIT<cr>.Halt Tenex.	l6703x6e12jk40\1u10U2u8U2u1U9u1UWait for the EDDT preakpoint at SWHLT1.  A message such as "$8B>>CHKADR BUGCHK/ SWHLT1" should be printed out.	l5468x6e6jk40Once Maxc1 and Maxc2 systems have halted you may proceed by stopping the rest of the systems in the Maxc room.	l5468x6e6jk40	Ivy		 From an Alto or DLS terminal:	x6e12jk40\1b3BChat Ivy<cr>	Ena<cr>			NOTE 1:	You must be an Ivy wheel.	Halt<cr>Quit<cr>l5468x6e6jk40\24bi7BI20i5I	Twinklex6e12jk40\1b7BCtrl-Shift-D		(to turn on display)	Position cursor over "gateway" window, press down middle button, select "gateway" menu, let up button.Press down middle button, select "quit" item, let up button.	l5468x6e6jk40	Junipery720x6e12jk40\1b7BShift Swat	l5468x6e6jk40	DLSx6e12jk40\1b3BQuit<cr>l5468x6e6jk403.  Removing System Power	x6e12jk40\f5b25f0B	Maxc1 & Maxc2 Disk Drives	x6e12jk40\1b25BTurn off Front switch first, then the switch in the rear.	l5468x6e12jk40NOTE 2:	An alternate procedure, (which is not advised due to the fact that some				circuit breakers may be in the off state prior to shutdown for some reason,				and the difficulty in correctly identifying all of them may lead to errors				when restoring power) instead of turning off the switch in the rear of each				disk drive, is to wait until everything else in this section has been done and				then throw all the circuit breakers on the Maxc, Maxc-A and Maxc-B Circuit				Breaker Panels, noting carefully the ones which are already off.	l6703x3e12jk40\bi8f1BI34ui3UI456i16I1i30I1f0	Maxc1 NOVA	x6e12jk40\1b10B3301P<cr>M.Crtl A	Power Off<cr>	Rl5468x6e12jk40			NOTE 3:	At present the processor power on Maxc1 cannot be turned ON or OFF							under program control.
