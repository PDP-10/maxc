CREATING AND DESTROYING MAXC ACCOUNTSy702x3e12c(635)\b42B24.1.  Obtaining a Maxc Accountx3e36\b31BMaxc directories are requested via a directory-request form obtainable from Haychan Sargent.  The following forms are available:	x3e12jFiles-only directory application (Figure 7, Appendix)CSL, SSL, SDD application (Palo Alto employees only) (Figure 8, Appendix)Xerox non-Palo Alto or non-Xerox application (Figure 9, Appendix)l5080x3e12\34b10i8BI56b10i8BI48b10i8BIThe top part of a directory application is filled out by the applicant and his supervisor.  The form then migrates to Hal Murray (SDD), Larry Masinter or Ted Strollo (SSL), or Ron Weaver (other) who does the following:	x3e12jVerifies that the directory name is not in conflict with an existing directory and that the password is reasonably unguessable;l3969x3e12Approves the directory request and fills in the directory parameters on the form;l3969x3e12For ordinary cases, the account administrators fill out the form, sign it, create the directory, and send the form to R. Weaver, who in turn signs the form, create the account, and passes the form on  to Haychan Sargent, who is in charge of Maxc account files.  A non-standard case is passed to E. Fiala for approval before the directory is created.  Directory creation of requests is normally carried out by Ron Weaver (<RWEAVER>), who may also create directories for the other account administrators.x3e12jThe various steps in creating a Maxc directory are discussed below.  After the directory is created, the application form goes back to Haychan Sargent who files the form and passes the new directory information to Kathi Anderson for updating message distribution list files and Lynn Harrington for updating the phone lists.	x3e12jFor PARC personnel, the Maxc directory application may also be used as an application for an IFS directory on IVY.  The requestor checks the "MAXC Account" and/or "IVY Account" box to request a Maxc and/or  Ivy directory.  Note that only one application is filed for a directory, regardless of whether that directory exists on only Maxc, only Ivy, or both.	x3e12j24.2.  General Information About Maxc Directoriesx3e36\b49BPasswordsx3e12\i9IInitial passwords are required to be unpronounceable and relatively unguessable.  However, there is nothing to prevent the user from changing his password later, so we can't guarantee this.  We do not permit passwords for "regular" directories (as opposed to message-only directories) to be known to more than one person; this guards the system against unauthorized access.	x3e12jUpper and lower case characters are equivalent for passwords, so it is not necessary to be careful about case while entering passwords.	x3e12jUser groups and Directory groupsx3e12\i32ITenex file and directory protection distinguishes between three classes of access:	x3e12jself (someone logged into or connected to the directory);same group (someone logged into a directory in the same group);others.l5080x3e12Putting a user's login directory into a User Group allows him to access other directories in that group in the same group mode.	x3e12j\111i10IPutting a directory into a Directory Group allows other users in that group access in the same group mode.x3e12j\90i10IDirectories are usually setup so that new files created in that directory will permit total owner access, read-only same-group access, and no access to others.  Most new directories are assigned to the Computer-research user group and directory group.  There are many exceptions.	x3e12jA list of the current groups is supposed to be kept in <ACCOUNTS>GROUP-LIST.NUMBERS and was as follows on 4 October 1979:	x3e12j0	Computer-research	12	Graphics1	System	13	Pogos2	Mesa	14	Nova3	Secretaries	15	PARC4	Lisp	16	XMS-users5	Understander	17	User-Sciences6	Bliss	18	ITG7	Inter-Network	19	Mesa-users8	Customer Programming	20	Reyes9	University MPC	21	SSL Group Leaders and Secretaries10	Alto	22	JDS11	Parcpub	23	University Grantl3969x3e12(0,4763)(1,9843)(2,10636)Most Xerox user directories are put in the Computer-research directory and in no other groups.	x3e12j(635)File Protectionx3e12\i15IThe file protection assigned a directory is the default protection of new files created in that directory.  The file protection is an 18-bit number divided into three 6-bit groups.  This number breaks down into three fields, identical in format, each of which can be regarded as containing two octal digits or six binary bits.  The first 6-bits define owner protection, second same-group protection, and third general-public protection.  The interpretation of the bits in a group is as follows:x3e12jB0	Read contents of fileB1	Write onto fileB2	Execute program stored in fileB3	Append to fileB4	Access per page tableB5	--l5080x3e12k40Setting a bit to 1 permits the action; setting it 0 denies the action.  Taking these six bits as a two digit octal number, some common values are:  77, which permits full access; 52, which protects a file from modification but permits other functions; and 00, which denies everything.  [Refer to Figure 6, Appendix for correct values corresponding to boxes on Files-only account request form.]	x3e12j\296b10i8B1IDirectory Protectionx3e12\i20IIn addition to specifying the access allowed to file contents, Tenex allows directory contents to be protected similarly.  The directory protection word is composed of three 6-bit fields, one field each for "self", "group", and "others" similar to the file protection word.  The bits have meaning as follows:x3e12jB0	If off, completely prevents use of the directory in any wayB1	Files may be opened subject to file protectionB2	Owner functions permitted (including CONNECT) without passwordB3	Files may be added to the directoryB4	--B5	--l5080x3e12Directory protection can only be changed by someone with WHEEL status.  Some common values of Directory protection are:  776060, which permits the owner to do everything, other users to read-write files according to file protection; 777760 permits the owner and same group to do everything, others to read-write according to protection (typically used for files-only directories); 777700 permits owner and same group everything, general public nothing (typically used for files-only directories that one doesn't want non-group people to see); 777060 permits owner everything, same group connect access (typically used for files-only directories in the Computer-research group, where you want everyone to be able to connect but not to be able inadvertently to clobber files while not connected).  [Refer to Figure 6, Appendix for correct values corresponding to boxes on Files-only account request form.]	x3e12j\806b10i8B1IDisk Limitx3e12\i10IPresently, message-only directories are assigned a disk limit of 50 which is enforced.x3e12Regular directories are assigned a disk limit that varies according to the organization:  CSL, 1000 pages; SSL, 750 pages; SDD, ASD, and other, 250 pages.  This varies when special needs are present.  Disk limits for regular directories are not "enforced", which means that file storage in these directories can exceed allocation without difficulties (except an annoying "over allocation" message from Tenex) until total free storage in the system falls below 2000 disk pages.  When free storage is below this, attempts to write new files into directories over allocation are denied.	x3e12jProject Groupx3e12k80\i13IThe project group assigned a directory classify it for the accounting software, which summarizes CPU utilization, file storage use, etc. according to these groups.	x3e12jk80The current project groups are CSL, CSL-Summer, CSL-Consultants, CSL-Files-only, Defunct, SSL-unknown, SSL, SSL-RI-PT-Contract-VS, SSL-Consultants, SSL-Files-Only, University-MPC, Lisp-Files-Only, ICL, SDD, Mesa, GSL, JDS, OSL, Administration-not-on-phone-list, Administration, SDD/LA, ADL, PARC, PD/LA, ED/LA, Xerox, Non-Xerox, Computer-Research, Tenex, ASD/PA, ASD/ES, Webster, EOS/Pasadena, Old-NonPARC and Versatec.  Directories are attached to these projects by editing the <ACCOUNTS>PROJECTLIST file.	x3e12jThe  PROJECTLIST file is used by the MAXC-ACCT subsystem discussed later.  It is important that this file be updated correctly, but Tenex will run correctly even when this file is invalid or incomplete.x3e12jThe format of a group in the PROJECTLIST file is as follows:x3e12CSL:AIS, ALISP, ..., WINOGRAD, YEARY;l5080x3e12i.e., the group name followed by a ":", the list of directory names in alphabetical order separated by "," and terminated by ";".	x3e12jFiles-only Directoriesx3e12\i22IFiles-only directories are created when needed, usually to hold files needed by a number of different users working on a common project.  Tenex does not allow login to files-only directories.  Each files-only directory is represented by a line in the <SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT file of the form:	x3e12jOWNER,FILEDIRECTORYl5080x3e12where OWNER is the login directory name of the person responsible for FILEDIRECTORY.  <SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT is needed by the archive system to direct messages about archive traffic to OWNER.  By convention, the entries in ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT are in alphabetical order by owner, and where there are several files-only directories for a single owner, these are also in alphabetical order.	x3e12j<SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT is also used by the HOGS program, discussed below, to associate disk usage of files-only directories with the login account for the person responsible for the storage.x3e12jLogin Directoriesx3e12\i17IEach login directory is represented by a line in the file <ACCOUNTS>UACHK.TXT.  The standard entry in this file is as follows:	x3e12jACCOUNTANT:1*,BACKGROUNDl5080x3e12This line controls the pie slice scheduling groups accessible to the directory.  The "1*" means that the default login pie slice is the numerically named account number 1; the ",BACKGROUND" means that after login, the user can change his pie slice to the low priority BACKGROUND slice.x3e12jk40Nearly all directories are represented by a UACHK.TXT entry in the above format.  However, a few directories for people who maintain the hardware or do other special stuff, may be allowed to access some other slices.  For example:	x3e12jSYSTEM:1*,BACKGROUND,SERVICE,MAINT,ARPANET,220100l5080x3e12This allows the <SYSTEM> directory to change its scheduling slice to BACKGROUND, SERVICE, MAINT, ARPANET, or 220100.	x3e12jThe UACHK.TXT file is compiled into a big accounting matrix which is stored on <SYSTEM>UACHK.FILE during the procedure for creating or destroying directories.	x3e12jMessage Userx3e12\i12IMessage-only users have very limited access to subsystems and have enforced disk limits.  The subsystems accessible to message-only users are specified in <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.directory-name, if it exists, or in <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.DEFAULT, if no special file exists for the directory.  It is required that subsystem names in these files be in alphabetical order.  <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.DEFAULT presently contains the following:x3e12j<PUP>EFTP.SAV<SUBSYS>ARCVER.SAV<SUBSYS>DELVER.SAV<SUBSYS>MSG.SAV<SUBSYS>PLZFIX.SAV<SUBSYS>PRESS.SAV<SUBSYS>READMAIL.SAV<SUBSYS>SEE.SAV<SUBSYS>SNDMSG.SAV<SUBSYS>XMS.SAVl5080x3e12If a special <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.directoryname file is created for a message-only directory, it will generally contain all of these files plus the extra ones that are added for the directory.	x3e12j24.3.  The EcCREATE and EcPRINT Commandsx3e36\b12o4 1o0 12o4 1o0 14BDirectories are created and destroyed using the Tenex Executive's EcCREATE command (i.e., <control-E>CREATE), which has subcommands that allow properties of the directory to be specified.  The various subcommands for EcCREATE are discussed here, and then examples where directories are actually created and destroyed are given in the following sections.  The current properties of any directory can be observed by using the EcPRINT command.  User encrypted password is printed out as two octal numbers by using the "verbose" form of the ^E Print commnad (that is, "^EPrint dirName Verbose").  This is useful in comparing Maxc1 and Maxc2 passwords, or transferring a password from one system to the other, without knowing the clear-text version of that password.  You must have enabled your WHEEL or OPERATOR status to execute CREATE or PRINT.	x3e12j\67o4 1o0 150o4 1o0 206o4 1o0CREATE and its subcommands:x3e12j!EcCREATE username [NEW] (password) password,<cr> [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>l3969x3e12k40\2o4 1o0The default parameters of a new directory are as follows:l5080x3e12DISK limit = 750 pages (not enforced)DEFAULT file protection = 775200PROTECTION of directory = 776060USER group number = 0 (Computer-Research)DIRECTORY group number = 0 (Computer-Research)NUMBER of directory = next unused numberno special capabilitieshas a mailbox (i.e., has a MESSAGE.TXT file)l6033x3e12If the directory is not supposed to be in the Computer-Research user group or directory group, you will have to remove it from this group using the NOT DIRECTORY and/or NOT USER subcommands below.l5080x3e12!!ABORT	= Cc!!NUMBER dirnumber	for setting directory number.  When creating a new	directory on Maxc1, the directory number is defaulted	to the next unused number.

Be sure to do this on both Maxc1 and Maxc2.  Subsequently, new directories you create will re-use directory numbers of directories that once existed but have been deleted.l3969x2e6j\f1 222f0!!DEFAULT<esc> (file) PROTECTION 6-char octal number			 sets the default file	protection for directory	!!DIRECTORY groupnumber	argument is one of the directory group numbers given	earlier--repeat this subcommand for multiple directory	groups!!SECONDARY groupnumber	argument is one of the directory group numbers given	earlier--repeat this subcommand for multiple directory	groups!!USER groupnumber	argument is one of the directory group numbers given	earlier--repeat this command for multiple directory	groups!!DISK limitinpages	sets disk limit	!!ENFORCE	causes disk limit to be enforced	!!PROTECTION<esc> (of directory) dirprotec						 sets directory protection!!LIST	prints the status of the directory as EcPRINT would	do if the CREATE command were terminated now!!NO MAILBOX1	Prevents MESSAGE.TXT file from being created.	This will be issued on either Maxc1 or Maxc2 for	regular and message-only accounts.

When	Laurel has been developed further, there will prob-	ably be a number of user directories that do not have	mailboxes on either system.

Creating a Maxc Directoryx3e36(635)\b32BYou have to be a WHEEL or OPERATOR to create or destroy a Maxc directory, change the password, or do other kinds of directory maintenance.	x3e12j1.  Enable yourself and connect to the ACCOUNTS directory on Maxc1.  Then do a WHO or LD and make sure that none of the other users who diddle with the accounting are at that time also modifying the accounting files.  They would be connected to the ACCOUNTS or SYSTEM directory, if they were doing this.	x3e12j2.  For login and message-only directories (as opposed to files-only directories) edit UACHK.TXT to contain the new directory name.  For files-only directories edit <SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT to contain the new directory name.  For all directories edit <ACCOUNTS>-PROJECTLIST to contain the directory in the appropriate places.  If you are creating a number of directories, you can do the edits for all of the directories at once, which saves time.	x3e12jFor some message-only directories, additional subsystems will be specified; these will require the creation of a <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.username file which should include the contents of <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.DEFAULT plus the additional subsystem names.  We follow the convention of preserving alphabetical ordering of the names in each section of these files.	x3e12j3.  EcCREATE the directory on Maxc1 using one of the following examples as a prototype:x3e12\5o4 1o0Message-only directory:x3e12\i23I!EcCREATE username [NEW] password,<cr>   (Don't omit the ",") [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>!!MESSAGE<cr>	Makes message-only directory!!DISK 50<cr>	Sets the disk limit to 50 pages!!ENFORCE<cr>	Enforce the disk limit!!LIST<cr>	List the properties of the directory and make sure that	all the parameters are setup as desired!!<cr>	Execute the CREATE with properties as setup [CONFIRM]<cr>l3969x3e12(0,10160)\2o4 1o0Files-only account:x3e12(635)\i19I!EcCREATE username [NEW] password,<cr>   (Don't omit the ",") [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>!!FILES<cr>	Makes files-only directoryl3969x3e12(0,10160)\2o4 1o0!!LIST<cr>	List the properties of the directory and make sure that	all the parameters are setup as desiredl3969x3e3k40!!<cr>	Execute the CREATE with properties as setup [CONFIRM]<cr>l3969x3e3k40Regular directory:x3e12(635)\i18I!EcCREATE username [NEW] password,<cr>   (Don't omit the ",") [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>!DISK 1000<cr>	Sets the disk limit to 1000 pages!!LIST<cr>	List the properties of the directory and make sure that	all the parameters are setup as desired!!<cr>	Execute the CREATE with properties as setup [CONFIRM]<cr>l3969x3e12(0,10160)\2o4 1o04.  After creating the directory you should print the parameters of the directory and write down the directory number, which you will need shortly:	x3e12j(635)!EcPRINT username<cr> [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>DISK LIMIT 1000WHEELALPHANUMERIC ACCOUNTSDIRECTORY NUMBER 15	Write down this number for laterDEFAULT FILE PROTECTION 500000775200DIRECTORY PROTECTION 500000776060USER GROUPS: 0, 1DIRECTORY GROUPS: 0, 1l3969x3e12k80(0,10160)\2o4 1o0 110i32I5.  If you are creating a number of directories at once, you should carry out a EcCREATE sequence for each of them at this time.	x3e12j(635)\81o4 1o06.  Next, you have to reinitialize the accounts on Maxc1 as shown below, and then copy the resulting stuff to Maxc2 where a similar but slightly different sequence is carried out:	x3e12j!RUNFIL UACHK.RUNFIL<cr>	Reads UACHK.TXT and creates UACHK.FILE on	the connected directory (you are still connected to	<ACCOUNTS>) [This step is necessary for message-	only and regular directories but is not needed for	files-only directories.]	l3969x3e12j(0,10160)--Check for any error messages before continuing--l3969x3e12(635)!EcINITIALIZE ACCOUNTS<cr>	Renames UACHK.FILE onto the <SYSTEM>		directory and installs it as the current accounting	matrix [This step is necessary for message-only and	regular directories but is not needed for files-only	directories.]!PUPFTP MAXC2<cr>*CONN ACCOUNTS<cr>*PRESERVE VERSION<cr>*STORE PROJECTLIST<cr><cr><User password incorrect LOGIN (user) YOURDIRECTORY yourpassword<cr>*STORE <SYSTEM>UACHK.FILE<cr><cr>	copy <SYSTEM>UACHK.FILE on Maxc1 to	<ACCOUNTS>UACHK.FILE on Maxc2.

You also	have to copy <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.username if	you added or modified any of these files.	*QUIT<cr>!DET<cr>l3969x3e12j(0,10160)\2o4 1o0--Chat to Maxc2--x3e12j(635)@ENABLE yourpassword<cr>	!CONN ACCOUNTS<cr>	!EcCREATE username [NEW] password,<cr>   (Don't omit the ",")	 [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>	!!same subcommands as on Maxc1	!!NO MAILBOX<cr>	You only create a mailbox, i.e., a MESSAGE.TXT	file, 	on one of the two Maxc systems.  Normally	the mailbox is created on Maxc1 and you give the	NO MAILBOX subcommand on Maxc2.  However,	for a primary user of Maxc2, the mailbox is put on	Maxc2 and you would issue NO MAILBOX when	you CREATEd the account on Maxc1.	!!NUMBER directory-number (from EcPRINT above)	!!<cr>	 [CONFIRM]<cr>	l3969x3e12j(0,10160)\48o4 1o0 491o4 1o0If you are creating a number of directories, then you go ahead and create the others at this time, remembering to add the NO MAILBOX and DIRECTORY dirnumber subcommands in addition to the stuff you did on Maxc1.  Then when you have created all of them, you finish up with the following:x3e12j(635)!EcINITIALIZE ACCOUNTS<cr>	Initializes the accounts, renaming	<ACCOUNTS>UACHK.FILE to	<SYSTEM>UACHK.FILE [This step is necessary for	message and regular directories but not needed for	files-only directories.]	l3969x3e12j(0,10160)\2o4 1o0Note that if you have a number of Maxc directories to create at once, you can insert all the names into the UACHK.TXT, PROJECTLIST, and ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY during the same editting session.  Then you can EcCREATE all the directories.  Then you do the RUNFIL, INITIALIZE ACCOUNTS, and PUPFTP of the files just once.  Then you Chat to Maxc2, CREATE all the directories there, and finally do the INITIALIZE ACCOUNTS just once on Maxc2.x3e12j(635)\204o4 1o024.5.  Editing the Grapevine Data Base	x3e36j\bThe Grapevine data base must be edited to contain the correct directory name and password for all new Maxc accounts.  It must also be edited to delete the directory name for all Maxc accounts that are destroyed.  To do this you should have version 6T15 or later of Laurel so you can run program Maintain, the Grapevine Registration Server Maintenance Program.	x3e12jRun Laurel and bug "Run" in the lower command menue.  Type Maintain<cr> and control will pass to the Grapevine Registration Server Maintenance Program.

Changing the Password and Other Modifications to Directoriesx3e36\b67BThe EcCREATE command is also used to modify parameters for an existing directory.  When used in this way, directory parameters are initially defaulted to the current parameters of the directory, so only those items being changed need be typed as subcommands.	x3e12j\5o4 1o0Note:  It is illegal to change the directory number or the name of the directory in this way.  To do this it is necessary to destroy and recreate the directory and copy files manually.	x3e12jWhen using CREATE in this way you omit typing the password, so that you don't have to be told the password of the directory in order to change its parameters.  For example:	x3e12j!EcCREATE olddirectoryname,<cr>    (Don't omit the ",") [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>!!NOT USER 0<cr>	Remove from Computer-research user group!!USER 1<cr>	Add to System group!!NOT DIRECTORY 0<cr>!!DIRECTORY 1<cr>!!PASSWORD xglot1<cr>	Change the password!!<cr> [CONFIRM]<cr>l3969x3e12(0,10160)\2o4 1o0
