LOADING THE NOVA DISKy702x3e12c(635)\b26BMaxc1 only.  This procedure need be followed only if the "Maxc Nova" disk has been wiped out and must be reloaded from scratch.	e12j\i11IA.	Get the current "10SYS" tape from the tape rack and mount it on unit 0.1  Note that the tape unit above and to the left of the Nova should be selected as unit 0.  Set the Nova console switches to 100022.  Make sure the tape drive is in remote and at the load point.	e12j\74f1o4 1f0o0B.	Push "Reset" followed by "Program Load" on the Nova front panel.  The Infoton should print out:e12FULL(0) or PARTIAL(1)?l5080e12and you should type "0" which will clear the Nova disk directory, read-in a fresh copy of Nova DOS from magtape unit 0, and rewind the tape.	e12jC.	Load files from the 10SYS tape by typing the following:e12LOAD/A/V MT0:n; INSTALL MAXCSYS.SY <cr>l5080e12where n is the tape file containing all system files (usually 2;  consult the label on the tape jacket).e12\6u1UD.	Now set the Nova's console switches to 100040.  Subsequently, pressing "Reset" followed by "Program Load" will cause DOS to be re-booted from the disk, leaving the file system intact.	e12jE.	If at some later time the Nova should fail to boot from disk (e.g., because the MAXCSYS.SY file has been deleted or clobbered), it is possible to boot from tape.  Mount the 10SYS tape on unit 0, set the console switches to 100022, hit "Reset", then "Program Load".  When the Infoton prints out:e12jFULL(0) or PARTIAL(1)?l5080e12type "1", which reads in DOS from tape but does not affect files on disk.  You should now restore DOS to the disk, as follows:	e12jXFER MT0:1 MAXCSYS.SYCHATR MAXCSYS.SY SPW; INSTALL MAXCSYS.SYl5080e12------------------------------1It is customary to hang the tape jacket from the clip mounted on the door of the tape unit, and for novices to remove the write ring from tapes.	y130e12j\f1o4 32o0 144f0 1f1
