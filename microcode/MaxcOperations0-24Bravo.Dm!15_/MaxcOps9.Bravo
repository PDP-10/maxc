ALTIOy702x3e2c(635)\b9BMaxc2 only.  AltIO serves the same purpose running on the Maxc2 Alto as NVIO does on the Maxc1 Nova, though it has a much smaller complement of devices to service (just the Alto monitor, the Diablo printer and the Ethernet).	x3e12j\1i11I9.1.  Calling AltIOx3e12\b19BAltIO may be called either from Midas or directly from the Alto Executive.  In Midas, selecting "AltIO" with the mouse causes a menu of AltIO subcommands to appear.  Selecting "Do-It" causes AltIO to be started with no options selected;  in this case, AltIO performs no initialization but simply resumes the microprocessor at its current location.  If other subcommands are selected before "Do-It", they modify the initial actions of AltIO in various ways.	x3e12jWhen AltIO is called directly from the Alto Executive, the same options may be specified by switches.  The general form of the AltIO command line is:	x3e12j	AltIO/switches  parameter/switch  parameter/switch ...x3e12(0,5080)(1,65535)The switches immediately following "AltIO" correspond to Midas "AltIO" menu items in the following way:	x3e12j(635)Switch	Menu Item	Descriptionx3e12j(0,4445)(1,8096)\b28B/B	Boot-MExec	Boot Micro-Exec into Maxc memory and start it.x3e12/H	Dont-Go	Leave Maxc halted rather than resuming it.x3e12/P	Protect	Enter "protected" mode in AltIO.  This means that AltIO will		allow only those commands that examine (but do not write into)		memory and that do not change machine state.	x3e12j/R	Reset-Memory	Reset the memory system.x3e12/S	Start-Tenex	Start Tenex, first booting Micro-Exec from disk as for /B and then		executing an automatic "Go" command.	x3e12jThe optional additional parameters may be specified only in the Executive command line;  there is no way to invoke them from Midas.	x3e12j(635)filename/L	Load a PDP-10 "save"-format file into Maxc memory (default extension .SAV).	Used for loading PDP-10 diagnostics when Micro-Exec won't work.	x3e12j(0,6033)(1,65535)n/U	Use disk unit n rather than unit 0 in Boot-MExec and Start-Tenex commands,	where 0 corresponds to unit A and 7 to H.	x3e12j9.2.  AltIO Commandsx3e12jk80(635)\b20BWhen AltIO is running, the Alto monitor is divided by black lines into three windows.  If Tenex is running, the top window continuously displays the addresses and contents of five interesting Maxc main memory variables.  The middle window belongs to a command processor for controlling AltIO itself.  The bottom window implements the Maxc controlling terminal used by Tenex and by stand-alone programs such as Micro-Exec and PDP-10 diagnostics.	x3e12jKeyboard input is directed to whichever window currently contains the blinking cursor.  The middle and bottom unmarked keys on the right side of the keyboard may be used to direct input to the middle and bottom windows respectively.  Keyboard input is automatically switched to the bottom window when Maxc is started by commands such as "Boot" or "Go", and to the middle window when Maxc stops for any reason.	x3e12jThe AltIO command processor has two heralds, a number sign (#) which indicates that only commands that examine memory are legal, and a colon (:) which indicates all commands are legal.x3e12jAltIO commands consist of a single letter or other special character, optionally preceded by a numeric argument.  The argument is an octal number of up to 40 bits, depending on the command.  While typing an argument, one may use the editing characters control-A, control-W, and Delete to erase, respectively, a single character, a word, or the entire command.	x3e12jMany AltIO commands request confirmation with "[confirm]".  The confirming character is a Return or period.  Most of AltIO's commands are intentionally the same as in NVIO;  the ones for which this is true are marked with a superscript "1".	x3e12jn/1	Change the current Maxc memory location to n; and print out the contents of that	location in the form:	x3e12j(0,5080)\2f1o4 1f0o0	aa bbbbbb ccccccx3e4(0,5715)	where:x3e4j(0,5080)	aa (0 to 17) is the last 4 bits (i.e., the "tag" bits) of the 40-bit Maxc memory word,	it is not printed out if zero;	x3e4j(0,5715)	andx3e4j(0,5080)	bbbbbb and cccccc are the left and right half 18 bits of the PDP-10 (Maxc) word.x3e4j(0,5715)/	Print out the current location.x3e12(0,5080)n<cr>1	Put the 40-bit number n into the current location.  The first 4 bits input are the last 4	bits of the memory.  Thus one can think of Maxc as a 36-bit machine (like the PDP-	10), right adjusted in a 40-bit field, rather than a 36-bit machine left adjusted in a 40-	bit word as is actually the case.	x3e12j\5f1o4 1f0o0	This command is only legal after a command which prints out a Maxc memory	location.x3e12j<lf>1	(lf means linefeed).  Change the current location to the current location plus 1, and	print out the (new) current location.	x3e12j\4f1o4 1f0o0n<lf>1	Equivalent to n, <carriage return>, <linefeed>.x3e12\5f1o4 1f0o0^1	Change the current location to the current location minus 1, and print out the	(new) current location.	x3e12j\1f1o4 1f0o0n^1	Equivalent to n, <carriage return>, <up arrow>.x3e12\2f1o4 1f0o0<tab>1	Change the current location to the location pointed to by the current location.  Print	out its contents.	x3e12j\5f1o4 1f0o0B1	Boot Micro-Exec from Save Area 1 of physical disk unit A.x3e12\1f1o4 1f0o0 1u1UnB1	Boot Micro-Exec from Save Area 1 of physical disk unit n (0=A, 1=B, etc.)  The	parameter n is remembered for subsequent "B" commands without arguments.	x3e12j\2f1o4 1f0o0 1u1UD	Toggle on or off a switch causing typeout on the Maxc controlling terminal (the	bottom display window) to be copied to the Diablo printer.  This switch is normally	off, but turning it on is useful when debugging Tenex or doing memory maintenance.x3e12jE	Print out the current state of Maxc's PDP-10 emulator.  This includes the program	counter and all the accumulators.  This command may be issued only when Maxc is	stopped.x3e12jnG1	Go to Maxc location n.  Precisely: stop the Maxc microprocessor (cleanly if possible),	then tell it to begin executing PDP-10 instructions at Maxc main memory location n.x3e12j\2f1o4 1f0o0 1u1UG	Go to the starting address of the currently loaded Maxc program, which is pointed to	by Maxc memory location 7.	x3e12jH1	Halt Maxc (cleanly if possible).x3e12\1f1o4 1f0o0 1u1UL	Prompt for a filename (default extension .SAV), then interpret that file as a PDP-10	"save"-format (not "ssave") file and load it into Maxc memory.  The program's	starting address is stored in location 7 so that a "Go" command without arguments	will start the program.  The file is expected to be in the 36-bit binary format defined	by FTP.  Retrieving a PDP-10 "save"-format file using the FTP program will cause	such a file to be created.	x3e12jM1	Halt Maxc (cleanly if possible) and return control to Midas.  Midas is resumed in	whatever state it was in when control was last transferred to AltIO from Midas.  This	is true even if AltIO has been exited and other Alto programs run in the meantime.x3e12j\1f1o4 1f0o0 55u1UnM1	Go to Microprocessor location n.  (If you use this command, you had better know	what you are doing.)	x3e12j\2f1o4 1f0o0 7u1UP1	Protect NVIO.  The herald becomes a number sign (#); only those commands that	examine memory (and other state varibles) are legal.	x3e12j\1f1o4 1f0o0 1u1UnP1	If the number typed is the Pass(word) number: AltIO becomes unprotected; the herald	becomes a colon (:) and all commands are legal.  Currently the pass(word) number is	3301; this should be easy to remember as it is the smallest number which is the sum	of two different cubes in two different ways.  (143 +13 =113 +123; octal of course.)x3e12jk40\2f1o4 1f0o0 28u1U34u1U242o4 1o0 3o4 1o0 4o4 1o0 4o4 1o0Q	Quit:  return control to the Alto Executive, after first stopping Maxc if it is running.x3e12R1	Resume Maxc (the microprocessor is told to proceed).  If a reset was previously done	("21M" to ODT or "21;G" to Midas), PDP-10 interpretation will begin at the starting	address pointed to by main memory location 7;  otherwise, Maxc will resume from	where it was halted.	x3e12j\1f1o4 1f0o0 1u1US1	Startup Tenex, booting Micro-Exec from disk unit A.x3e12\1f1o4 1f0o0 1u1UnS1	Startup Tenex, booting Micro-Exec from disk unit n (0=A, 1=B, etc.)x3e12\2f1o4 1f0o0 1u1UW	Print out the current state of Maxc (running, stopped, or at a micro breakpoint).x3e12Z	Zap Maxc memory:  reset and reconfigure the entire memory system.  Useful when	the memory has become hung up.  This command may be issued only while Maxc is	stopped.x3e12j
