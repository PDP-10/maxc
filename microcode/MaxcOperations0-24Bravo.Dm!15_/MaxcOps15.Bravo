(The "load" function of DMPLD is implemented by the AltIO "Load" command on Maxc2.)x3e12j\i11IDMPLD is a Nova program1 which can transfer stand-alone PDP-10 programs between Nova files and Maxc's memory.  At the present time, it is used only for loading PDP-10 diagnostics to assist in microcode debugging.	x3e12j\23f1o4 1f0o015.1.	DMPLD Operationx3e20\b21BTo load a PDP-10 .SAV program when you are in Nova DOS typex3e12	DMPLD<cr>x3e12(0,5080)(1,65535)and answer the LOAD FROM FILE question.  Type rubout and try again if you make a mistake.  This zeroes the first 32K of main memory before loading.	x3e12j(635)If you are in Midas, typex3e12	6,DMPLD;Tx3e12(0,5080)Normally you will have to prepare locations 3, 4, and 7 before running the program.  To make these changes, proceed as follows:	x3e12j(635)	DMPLD<cr> 	LOAD FROM FILE:  AUXD<cr> 	NVIO/H<cr> 	3/ 0   nnnnn<lf> 	4/ 0   nnnnn<cr>	7/ 0   nnnnn<cr>	M...OK.	DEB DMPLD<cr>	DMPLD%	DUMP$R	DUMP TO FILE:  AUXX<cr>x3e12(0,5080)\1u9U20u8U3u10U3u2U5u9U3u2U5u9U2u2U5u9U2u7U2u13U2u6U2u6U17u8UThe file will typically grow by a substantial amount when this is done because DMPLD does not compress out zeroes when dumping.	x3e12j(635)	DELETE AUXD<cr>	RENAME AUXX AUXD<cr>x3e12(0,5080)------------------------------1At present, the only way to create such a file on the Nova disk is to dump it from Maxc memory using DMPLD.  When Maxc was originally being bootstrapped, such files were created using a program called Mtape, which read Tenex "Mini-Dumper" tapes mounted on a 7-track drive which no longer exists.	y144x3e4j\f1 31o4 1o0 296f0If you want to dump a PDP-10 program you have created in core, you must exit back to DOS (by control-A or ;X to Midas).  Then dump the first 32K of main memory by typing	x3e12j	DEB DMPLD	DMPLD%	DUMP$Rx3e12The program will then ask DUMP TO FILE: and you should type a file name.  If you make a mistake type rubout and try again.	x3e12j(635)15.2.	Required Format for Standalone PDP-10 Programsx3e20\bDMPLD requires the program to be a .SAV file which resides in the low 32K of main memory.  DMPLD currently zeroes the low 32K of core before loading the program.	x3e12jThe interprocessor communication locations must be set up with pointers as follows:x3e12	3/	MTBS	Magtape, IMP, MCA, etc. 300-word block (octal;  may grow later)	4/	DLSBS	Data line scanner 104-word block	7/	STADR	Program starting addressx3e12(0,3810)(1,4763)(2,6826)Note that these are absolute main memory locations in the "shadow" of the accumulators, so they must be initialized in one of three ways:x3e12(635)	(1)	By hand from Midas or ODT	(2)	By mapping page 0 to a different virtual address	(3)	By using the JMC's for addressing absolute main memory addresses.x3e12(0,4763)(1,5874)(2,65535)The program must perform an I/O reset (CONO APR,200000) before carrying out input/output to any Nova related peripherals and after initializing MTBS and DLSBS as described above.	x3e12j(635)\56i6I63i5I
