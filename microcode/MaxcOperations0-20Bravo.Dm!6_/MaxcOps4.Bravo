POWER DOWNy684x3e2c(635)\b15BYou should not power down the processor or the memories by pulling plugs or throwing switches since this sudden shut down can damage components.  Only resort to this drastic action in an emergency (e.g., fire or when the Alto is broken so that the program for powering down cannot be executed).  If you do have to turn power off manually, try to turn all four switches for each particular memory cabinet off as sumultaneously as possible.	x3e12j\11i3I289i2IThe front panel switches for the disk drives should be turned off before powering down the microprocessor.	x3e12jAfter powering down the disks, then shut off the microprocessor and memories as follows:x3e12Power is turned off by running Midas and selecting the "Power-Off" and "Both" menu items.  Temporarily (as of 10/22/79), Midas cannot turn off the Port power supply.  To turn it on and off you must throw the front-panel switch labelled "Port on-off."	x3e12jWhen you power off, the two red lights on the processor and the four red lights on each memory will shut off.  The fans will continue to run and should be left on for at least 15 minutes.  You may then turn them off by pulling out their plugs in the backs of the cabinets, or by turning off the appropriate circuit breakers in the back room.	x3e12jIt is possible to turn the processor and memories on and off independently.  If only the processor needs to be turned off, it is best to leave the memories on so as to avoid shortening the life of the storage chips.	x3e12jThe choice of turning ON or OFF the processor or memories independently may be made by means of the subsidiary menus for the "Power-On" and "Power-Off" commands.	x3e12jTo totally turn off disks, turn off the front panel switches first.  Do not turn off AC power (in back) until the pack has stopped turning, else the drive may stop with the heads still extended!  Unless you are going to work on the disk drive, powering off the AC power in back is not required.x3e12jIf the Alto won't run, then you will have to power Maxc down manually.  It is very important to turn off all Maxc power supplies before turning off the Alto power.  To do this, first turn off the Maxc disk drives via the switches on the front panel.  Then turn off the four power supply switches on each memory cabinet.  Turn the four switches on each cabinet off as nearly simultaneously as you can to avoid possible problems in the power safety circuitry.  After you have powered down the memory cabinets, turn off the processor and port power supplies.	x3e12j\78u84U202i35I60i5IFinally, turn off the Alto disk, and when it stops the Alto processor.  If the processor is going to be powered off for a long time, you should also power down the Alto display.	x3e12jk40For most repairs to the Maxc processor, it is not necessary to power down the Alto.  However, if you are going to disturb the PMAINT, KMEMI, or PMEMI cards in the processor, it is imperative that you power down the Alto (after powering down Maxc).  It should be ok to leave the Alto running when other processor cards are pulled.	x3e12jk40
