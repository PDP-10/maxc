We recently hadproblems with <REID> vs. <BREID>, and as the PA registry increases, we canexpect a growing number of problems (proportional to the square of the numberof names in the registry).I would like to propose that on new personal directories for people in the PAregistry, we insist on (ordinarily) first-initial/last-name.  Also nickname (e.g.,<WILLIESUE> and <SMOKEY>) should be disallowed on new directories.In the past when we tried this, there were various situations which came upsuch as a person who came here for the summer with an existing directory atsome ARPA site with differing naming conventions.  We always succumbed torequests that the name on Maxc/PA be whatever the person wanted.  I proposethat we not succumb any more.Please answer this proposal with agreement or dissent.*start*00426 00024 US Date: 8 Sept. 1982 6:29 am PDT (Wednesday)From: RWeaver.PASubject: Re: MAXC ACCOUNT ACTIVITYIn-reply-to: Fiala's message of 7 Sept. 1982 4:19 pm PDT (Tuesday)To: Fialacc: RWeaver, Cude, Taft, SchroederEd,  I agree with your proposal.

I see little advantage in enforcing such a convention uniformly.  ThePA registry is now large enough that all the common names are already taken; anew Smith or Brown who comes along will necessarily be called MSmith orKBrown.  Less common names are less likely to be duplicated anyway.If we were redoing the entire PA registry, there might be some advantage to auniform naming structure, since it would make people's Grapevine R-nameseasier to remember.  But given the large existing community ofhaphazardly-chosen names, there is no advantage in imposing uniformity onnew names.  Finding out an unfamiliar person's Grapevine R-name will stillrequire looking it up in the PARC phone list or the RINN white pages, since howcan one know whether a name was assigned before or after the uniform namingconvention was instituted?Therefore, I am opposed to this proposal.	Ed*start*00530 00024 US Date:  4-Feb-83 10:33:10 PST (Friday)From: Kierr.paSubject: JSYS error 2000 via DLion FileToolTo: Taftcc: , Kierr.paEd,  I was doning a list of [Maxc]<*>SortDict.* and got the following in my Trinity-based FileTool window after a couple minutes:Remote list of SortDict.*Opening connection to Maxc ...

Air ConditioningTo: Taylor, Mitchellcc: Clark, ornstein, Taft, LampsonTaft and I have discussed it and we need to boost the air conditioning in the Maxc Room BEFORE the end of the year - if we are to avoid having Dorados we can't run.  We could argue about why this is true, given that before the last go-round we carefully described our needs to Lee and his people and despite this they seem to have cut corners and thus not met the need.  But I think that such argument won't be helpful. Ed and I are considering alternative placements (including, for example, Butler's suggestion for a "reduced" Maxc) - but it looks like the main problem could end up being the money to pay for it.  Ed says Lee Anderson indicated roughly $50K to install a new (additional) AC unit.  We need to start looking for that kind of money now.  My take is that until Lee begins to believe that such money is going to be forthcoming, we will only be able to get him marginally interested in the problem.  I believe that we should be prepared to sacrifice one Dorado ($'s), if necessary (and if possible).Seems to me the first step is to talk to Norb - right?

We can discuss things in more detail after you get back.Anderson, Beyer, Spencer, Squires, Taft, and Taylor were in attendance.Last Friday, Conrado Montes circulated a memo containing a recap of Maxc room cooling requirements (not significantly different from my memo of September 1980), and proposing a preliminary plan for providing additional cooling capacity.  The proposal is to raise the floor to increase under-floor volume, and to add a 20-ton air conditioning unit.  Cost: about $80K and 15 work days of downtime.  This requires significant construction work because the interior walls, doors, etc., are built on top of the raised floor.  Lee thinks that with all the other things going on at PARC, it's virtually inconceivable that this could be finished before the first 4th build Dorado arrives on September 30.Another possibility that was discussed is to remove all the under-floor electrical raceways and provide some alternate means of powering the equipment, thereby eliminating the under-floor obstructions to air flow.  Then add a new 20-ton unit as before.  Lee guessed that this would cost about the same or maybe more, but since it doesn't involve any significant construction work it might be done more quickly.  Even so, Lee is uncertain whether the 7-inch under-floor space is adequate even if free of obstructions.  He is now doing some measurements and calculations to determine this, and promised to report the results within a few days.Lee also thinks there are some less disruptive interim measures that can be taken to let us get a few more Dorados into the Maxc room, though not nearly adequate to get us all the way to 50.  This would tide us over until major work could be done, such as building a new machine room somewhere (and would also get us into next year's budget -- getting $80K out of this year's budget seems to be a big problem).  (By the way, getting rid of Maxc buys us 4.5 Dorados' worth of cooling.)This led to a more general discussion about how to house the 38 or so Dorados that will be arriving throughout PARC during the 4th build.  The two new machine rooms have plenty of excess capacity, but are too far away to be any help to CSL or ISL.  The Purple Lab has a little excess capacity right now, but not much.  The space occupied by Ken Beckman until recently could be converted into a machine room if necessary.  With some reshuffling, a few CSL users' Dorados could be located in that area.  Mumble.The conclusion was that the problem of how to house Dorados needs to be addressed at a PARC-wide level.  In your absence, you were nominated to chair a small committee to consider this (talk to Bob Taylor).	Ed*start*01778 00024 US Date: Thu, 30 Jun 83 15:45 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Maxc Leaf ServerTo: VanMellecc: Smalltalk80Support, Putz, Taft---------------------------Date: Thu, 30 Jun 83 15:16 PDTFrom: Putz.paSubject: MAXC Leaf ServerTo: Taftcc: Smalltalk80Support, PutzThis is not especially important, since I don't know anyone who really uses files on Maxc from Smalltalk, but I have noticed that the Maxc Leaf server is not exactly compatible with the IFS Leaf server.  In particular:1)  The user password must be all upper case, or Maxc will not recognize it.2)  Maxc will not recognize a user name if it ends in ".PA".The result of these incompatibilities is that Smalltalk cannot communicate with Maxc using Leaf.------------------------------------------------------------I don't know how important this is either, or even whether this exhausts the list of problems (for example, isn't the CR vs. CRLF incompatibility a source of trouble?)Both of these problems are actually shortcomings of the underlying Tenex implementation.  In particular:  (1) is a bug in one of the JSYSes that deal with logging in or checking passwords or something.  (I've forgotten the details, but I do remember running into the same bug.)  (2) should be dealt with by changing those JSYSes to handle Grapevine R-Names properly.I have never had the courage to mess around with this part of Tenex, however.  Both of these shortcomings have been programmed around in PUPSRV.  I suggest the same thing be done in LEAFSV.  In particular:  (1) can be fixed by always capitalizing passwords before passing them to JSYSes.  (2) can be fixed by stripping off a ".PA" suffix if it is present.  All Maxc user names are considered to be members of the PA registry.	Ed*start*00885 00024 US Date: Wed, 6 Jul 83 14:10 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Re: More ArpaNet StrangenessIn-reply-to: "Martin.eos's message of Wed, 6 Jul 83 13:14 PDT"To: Martin.eoscc: Taft, 1100support.eosThe Arpanet software on Maxc got into a bad state over the weekend that made it not possible to establish terminal connections.

My own impression is that we told Lee how many BTU's we would be putting out and he then provided the necessary air-conditioning to handle it.  Since it is now clear we don't have enough, I have been assuming that they simply goofed on their end of the deal.  I'm anxious to know your impression of what happened.Yesterday, in the course of discussing plans with Lee, I indicated gentle concern arising from "our" failure to kill the problem last time around.  I was startled to hear Lee claim that "we" never expected, on the last go around, to provide enough cooling for 50 Dorados - that that was only a "futuristic number", not what we were providing for then.  As evidence, he cited your memo - the one that included the calculations and described our needs.  I haven't been able to lay my hands on a copy or find the file and I am most curious to see one as that's not what I remember at all.  I think we were perhaps a tad low on our estimate of a Dorado's power consumption (because all we had to go on at that point was a few early 115 volt machines), but I thought we were definitely laying in plans for 50 of them.   It is true that we knew it would be some time before Maxc would go away and we would be able actually to house the full 50 machines, but I always understood that we were then and there arranging to pump into the room enough cooling and power to handle the final expected load (50) and that later we might at most have to locally rearrange some of the power when Maxc moved out to accomodate the final Dorados instead.My guess is that Lee, on his own, decided to save money by only providing for shorter term needs.  This is important (and sensitive) since if it was clearly their failure of execution, it will make it easier to get it fixed than if it was improper planning on our part.S.*start*02660 00024 US Date: 20 May 1983 1:01 pm PDT (Friday)From: ornstein.PASubject: Maxc Room CoolingTo: Leecc: Overton, Taylor, Taft, ornstein, Sosinski, YearyLee,I went over the Maxc Room with Charlie Sosinski.  We measured temperatures ata variety of points, experimented with pulling up floor tiles to increase air-flow(as we had discussed), etc.My conclusion is that we need to do something soon that is substantially morethan the minor adjustments Conrado has just done.  Perhaps continued fiddlingwill eventually produce results, but so far it hasn't helped enough.  We arealready operating marginally and several things are soon going to make it worse.	1. Summer students are coming and instead of having several idle	machines, all machines will be operating full tilt during the heat	of the day.	2. We are due to add more machines.	3. The weather is going to get hotter.We recently went through a major refurbishing that was supposed to handlemuch more than the present load.  It simply isn't coming close and that just hasto be fixed.  I'm no expert and don't want to interfere in the planning, but Ioffer the following observations:1. It seemed, from the calculations at our last meeting, that we are not getting asmuch cooling from the present setup as we should expect.2. At least part of the problem seems to be distribution:	a) the lower Dorados are generally about 5 degrees cooler than the upper	ones (75 degree vs. 80 degree input air) and this difference puts us over	the line for trouble.  Input temp. should be more like 70 degrees.	b) in addition, there are warmer and cooler areas within the room	c) the front Maxc room and the IMP room are MUCH cooler - of course	they contain comparatively little equipment      3. The pressure of air in the sub-floor plenum doesn't seem excessive so if were-piped both units to blow under the floor, perhaps it might help to get the coolair to where it is needed?4. The back (hot-air exiting) side of the right hand row of Dorados is particularlyhot and although Conrado tried to open up the ceiling to increase the returnflow, looking up through the grating I can see that much of the flow is blockedby other pipes etc.  That seems to be one of the worst problems at present -insufficient return path for that hot air. Please let me know what you can do about this before it becomes more of anemergency.SeveroP.S.  Mike handed me a sizeable piece of metal cutting that had apparently beendropped into the back of one of the Dorados while the ceiling was beingmodified.  Would you please ask folks to be a bit more careful.  Thanks.  *start*03986 00024 US Date: Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Planning for the demise of MaxcTo: AllPA^, IFSAdministrators^Reply-to: Taft.PA, RWeaver.PAWe are beginning to plan for the orderly shutdown and eventual decommissioning of our one remaining Maxc system.  The purpose of this message is to give early notice and to collect information about all the uses presently being made of Maxc so that we can determine whether those services will be provided elsewhere or could be terminated.  If you do not use Maxc (aside from Arpanet mail forwarding), you need not read this message.Why decommission Maxc?  There are several reasons:-- Maxc is old and tired and is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.  In particular, the disk drives are wearing out and are nearly impossible to fix due to shortage of spare parts and expertise.-- The machine room space and air conditioning capacity now consumed by Maxc could more profitably be devoted to additional Dorados.-- Nearly all the services originally provided by Maxc are now available elsewhere, usually in improved form; for example, electronic mail service by Grapevine, Lisp by Interlisp-D on D-machines, etc.  The residual uses are not sufficient to justify CSL's continuing to operate an obsolete time-sharing system.We are tentatively planning to shut down Maxc some time early in 1984.  It's unlikely we will be ready earlier than January 1.  You are requested to consider the impact a January 1 shutdown would have on your work, and to begin looking for alternatives to the services now being provided by Maxc.Here are our intentions with respect to the more important services:-- File storage.  Obviously, files still needed after the Maxc shutdown will have to be moved to other file servers.  Users will be responsible for arranging to move the contents of personal directories and files-only directories under their control.  Everything left behind will be archived to tape.-- Arpanet access.  A Cedar implementation of the ARPA TCP/IP protocols and of the mail translation and forwarding functions is now in progress.  This software will be installed on a Dolphin or Dandelion server that will entirely replace Maxc in its role as Arpanet mail gateway.-- Arpanet terminal access (Telnet) and file transfer (FTP) will be feasible to implement on top of the ARPA TCP/IP software; but there are no immediate plans to implement these.-- Magnetic tape access.  The tape drives are connected to an independent Alto tape server, which will continue to operate indefinitely.  There presently exist facilities in Alto/Mesa and in Cedar for accessing the tape server.  The tape server protocol is documented and is relatively simple, so accessing tapes from other environments should be straightforward.-- Tape archives.  We have approximately 600 tapes full of files archived from Maxc during the past 10 years.  We will make some provision for recovering files from the Maxc archive tapes.  However, this recovery procedure is unlikely to be convenient because the Maxc archive directories will no longer be on-line.  Therefore, we request that users examine their archive directories, retrieve any needed files before Maxc is shut down, and transfer them to other file servers.-- Application programs on Maxc.  In general, users will be responsible for obtaining computing services elsewhere, since CSL does not have the resources to convert application programs.  The only planned exception is the TEX document compiler.  We now have the capability to produce a Cedar version of TEX (by automatic translation from Pascal).  Though there is not a working version of TEX in current Cedar, we expect there to be one in the near future.If there are any other Maxc services on which you depend and which you can't obtain elsewhere, please bring them to our attention.  While it is unlikely that CSL will continue to provide such services, we may be able to suggest alternatives.*start*00419 00024 US Date: Sun, 21 Aug 83 12:14 PDTFrom: Ritchie.PASubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: "Taft's message of Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDT"To: Taft, RWeavercc: RitchieEd,The only facility which I use significantly and which is not scheduled for replacement is Telnet.

This makes italmost impossible to retrieve files from the tape archive.Surely the space required for these directories on a file server wouldnot be substantial, and it would enable someone to write the equivalentof the Maxc INTERROGATE/retrieve program with little difficulty.Interlisp-D on D-machines is NOT a substitute for Lisp on Maxc, becauseit isn't accessible from my home terminal!  In fact, NO PARC softwareexcept Grapevine is accessible from home.  I consider this a majorshortcoming of PARC's research program, and the demise of Maxc will bea major blow to my ability to work productively.To be specific, I use the following Maxc programs at home: LISP, SRCCOM,POET, and occasionally SNDMSG when Ernestine is down (since Ernestine'sfunction, unlike the mailbox function, is not replicated.)  Havingan account at another Arpanet site would not be satisfactoryunless there were either an Arpanet FTP server at PARC that could accessIFS files (unlikely in view of security considerations), or a Telnet/FTPUser accessible from the DLS.I realize that I am currently in a small minority in wanting to workat home, but I hope these considerations will lead to a littleconsciousness-raising in CSL on the subject.

My uses of MAXCare:1. Reading PARC electronic mail in a PARC machine so that Xerox-relatedmail does not transit the network and the various mailer programs.True, when I read the mail with Telnet, the text transits the network,but it is my suspicion that mail is more likely to be intercepted thanis terminal traffic.2. Keeping an archive. The MAXC archive is the finest I have ever hadavailable, and I have squirreled away a great many things of value (?)there.  I can, of course, become a tape wizard, using tape machineshere, and I am prepared to do that. However, I mourn the passing of avery fine service.3. File transfer from IFS's in the Xerox Internet to CMU so that I canprint Press files; file transfer the reverse direction so that I canwork on Xerox documentation (e.g., Interpress stuff).  I use this methoda GREAT deal; while I realize it may not be exactly according to therules of the ARPANET, I don't believe it violates the spirit of thenet.  As I understand it, this scheme will go away, and you do notplan to implement IP/TCP file transfer to/from the Internet.Summary: Your scheme is fine, but it would help me a lot if filetransfer were available.Bob*start*01009 00024 US Date: Mon, 22 Aug 83 11:30 PDTFrom: Subhana.PASubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: "Taft's message of Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDT"To: Taft, RWeavercc: SubhanaEd and Ron, I would imagine that I am a fairly typical secretarial user of MAXC.

We will have no way to examine mailing list archives or large remote files that are infeasible to mail through the Arpanet.  Similarly, a Xerox user will no longer be able to make such a large file or archive available to anyone else on the Arpanet.Without TELNET access, we will be cut off from all software and applications that may be runnable on the Arpanet.  We will no longer be able to run application programs on other Arpanet machines on which we may have accounts (MIT-*, SAIL, SCORE, CMU, Rand, etc.).

Will there be a way to take my data files out of archive, put them temporarily on a file server, and make a tape?  The data files are unformated ascii text files.  The decomissioning of archiving seems outrageous to me.  Perhaps CSL should not have to bear the expense of archiving all of Parc's files, but it is dangerous and expensive not to have some kind of archiving.  It is inconceivable to go without archiving.   The file servers would clog up in a month.  Moreover, once an archive facility is established, assuming it is, it would waste man-years of Parc's effort to force them to "examine their archive directories, retrieve any needed files before Maxc is shut down, and transfer them to other file servers."  Can you remember what's in a file that's two years old given only the file name?  I sure can't.  It would waste tons of my time to unarchive all the likely files, read them, and decide which to save.  If everyone did that (and what other choice do they have, if the old archive isn't continued), it would clog maxc,  wear Ron out unarchiving useless files, and waste many people's time.  We should save the whole archive, even if it is 600 tapes.  -- Kurt  *start*02044 00024 US Date: Mon, 22 Aug 83 13:33 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Arpanet FTP & Telnet accessTo: Taylor, Fiala, Ornstein, Schroeder, MBrown, Lampsoncc: RWeaver, TaftFirst of all, I hope you people don't mind my using you as an informal review committee for proposals relating to the Maxc shutdown.Ron and I have received quite a lot of responses already.  In a few days I will summarize them and compose replies to the most frequently expressed comments.Not surprisingly, the most controversial issue was that of FTP and Telnet access to the Arpanet, which I said we are not signing up to implement.  There are a lot of people who say that this capability is important to them.  Connections originated from within Xerox and connections originated outside both seem to be important.Assuming the successful outcome of our Cedar TCP/IP implementation, building Telnet and FTP on top is technically straightforward.  The reasons I did not want to commit to doing this are:  (1) While straightforward, it's still a lot of work, especially for FTP which is a fairly elaborate and complicated protocol.  (2) There are all sorts of security and access control ramifications that would have to be carefully thought out.  The needed mechanisms might be as much work to implement as the basic Telnet and FTP protocols.There is another alternative that has just recently come to my attention.  There is a company called Compion (formerly Digital Technology Inc.) which sells a software package implementing the complete suite of ARPA protocols for the VAX running VMS.  If we could get GSL to agree to install this on their VAX and to permit people to use the VAX to obtain the Telnet and FTP service they now get from Maxc, this would solve our problem.Prices: software, $15K; software maintenance, $4K; hardware to connect VAX to Imp, $5-10K (this is just a guess).		I don't see what's in this for GSL, so I doubt they'll be very interested.  But it does seem like the easiest approach if it's politically feasible.	Ed*start*02504 00024 US Date: 22 Aug 83 13:35:10 PDT (Monday)From: Woods.PASubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: Taft's message of Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDTTo: Taft, RWeavercc: WoodsI would feel the lack of Telnet, since I frequently read my mail from home by dialing into SAIL (which knows how to run my display) and crossing through Maxc to Ernestine.  Likewise, I often find I want to get hold of someone at Stanford on short notice, or take a look at a distribution list or other data file at Stanford, and so Chat from my Dandelion to Maxc and Telnet to SAIL to poke around.  Both of these uses can be handled using the autodialers here and at SAIL, but you should note that the increased use will result in higher phone charges.  If there are enough people in similar straits, the increase in charges might be severe enough to warrant allocating the manpower to implementing Telnet.The lack of FTP, though less severe because I use it less often, is much harder to circumvent.  I've found in the past that the DLS, at either 300 or 1200 baud, drops a lot of characters -- often entire lines -- when connected to SAIL.  Thus, dialing across and typing a file and capturing the session transcript is not really a feasible alternative (not to mention that it is quite slow).  Furthermore, some sites (notably SCORE) found that network mail was being used as a surrogate FTP, which bogged down the mailer; as a result, those sites now refuse to handle mail beyond a certain size, and there are threats of more severe repercussions if mail-cum-FTP continues.FTP definitely has its uses, since one of the big advantages of the Arpanet is that, having located a bit of useful research somewhere, you can fetch it over and use it without having to reconstruct it.  Just recently, I FTP'ed the high-speed text-search program I wrote at SAIL and converted it to Mesa; it will replace the official Find.bcd as of the next Mesa release.  Again, I am not in a position to analyse the impact, but I feel you should give further consideration to the question of when to implement FTP.Finally, there is the impact of MSG users forced to start using Lily.  Lily is obviously inferior in most ways, but for the most part this is mere inconvenience.  One such inconvenience that might have been overlooked, and might be feasible to fix, is that Lily has no way at present of handling private distribution lists.  Perhaps it can be made to handle distribution files on IFS's?	-- Don.*start*01058 00024 US Date: Mon, 22 Aug 83 14:01 PDTFrom: Putz.paSubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: "Taft's message of Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDT"To: Taft, RWeavercc: Putz, SCG^Reply-To: Putz.paSCG uses Maxc for its tape archive facility.  Periodically, we copy Smalltalk system images, etc. to [Maxc]<Smalltalk> for archival.  This is very useful, since it allows us to delete old unused files from our IFS without worrying about possibly losing important information forever.Without even the inconvenient archival facility of Maxc, the alternatives are filling our IFS with old unused files, or more likely, deleting those files forever.I strongly believe that the having project history information and data stored permanently (on tape, laser disk, etc.) is very valuable.  Often it is impossible to determine until much later what information should have been saved.It will be very unfortunate to have no usable tape archival facility.

I believe that archiving is very important, due to the facts about human nature.We need a semi-infinite, low cost place to easily put old files.  The act of archiving must be easy, so people do not have to think twice about doing it. Archives pay themselves back many times over when something is really needed (witness the source code for Laurel 7.0, etc.).  The projects going on at PARC are historic, and I believe that it is important to preserve the machine readable record of what happened.  For that matter, archived source code and memos will be extremely important if Xerox is ever involved in a software related lawsuit.If a person must know a lot about Cedar and the tape server, or must go to the MAXC room and load a tape to archive something, no one will ever do it.	Ted.P.S.What we need is a simple way to archive files from IFS servers.  Suppose that a person could archive a file from a file server by sending Ron Weaver a message.  He would batch the messages, copy the file names to a file, submit the file to a program, and run the tape server.  The program would write tape, delete the files from the file servers and send confirming messages.P.P.S.For those of us that have been archiving for nine years or so, it is important to be able to read the archive directories.

All of us occasionally (say around once a month) need to use MACSYMA or some equivalent symbolic manipulation system. Access to such a system is an important, and a times indispensible, tool for the research that we do.2. Many of us work in collaboration with people elsewhere on the arpanet, on joint papers and other projects. While a message facility will at least allow us to transfer the characters of a file back and forth, it requires the active cooperation of both sides each time and has no substitute for the ability to browse through your co-author's directory for relevant files. A number of standard compilers on maxc (Fortran, Pascal, Sail) give us at least some measure of program compatibility with the outside world.3. If we are to maintain TEX locally, we must be able to ftp new versions of the sources from Stanford. The same will be true of other Pascal->Mesa programs whose sources are updated elsewhere.4. Browsing on bulletin-boards elsewhere on the Arpanet is useful as a way to keep in touch with those places. And the ability to have a two way conversation over a telnet connection is always fun and at times useful.	Leo*start*00908 00024 US Date: 23 Aug 83 10:22:08 PDT (Tuesday)From: Danielson.PASubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: Taft's message of Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDTTo: Taft, RWeavercc: DanielsonMy main use of the Arpanet is mail and user FTP. Since mail access is being addressed, I will deal only with user FTP and simply give two examples of use during the past several months:1.

He seems very receptive of the idea that the VAX be used to replace certain services now provided by Maxc.  Specifically:(1) We purchase the hardware and software required to connect the VAX to the Arpanet, and use it to provide ARPA FTP and Telnet access.  See my previous message.(2) We use the VAX's tape archive system as a replacement for the one used on Maxc.  This does not eliminate the need for us to write a program for reading the old Maxc archive tapes.

EMACS or TECO from home.  I can do significant text editing this way, actually.  For replacement, I need a reasonable editor and a way to get to my Dorado's user exec, including a way to apply power to the Dorado if it's off, and boot it (Rollback? remote log-in?) if it gets wedged.2. University grant file distribution.  This is the only system that is reachable by Arpa types, at present.  An ARPA FTP with the right internal addressing structure and distribution list control will fix this one.3. Tape archives.  I claim we need a really reasonable and convenient set of facilities, probably Alpine-based, before we should give up Maxc.  I still use Maxc for file archive, even given the hassle of copying files from IFS's (often renaming to deal with subdirectories) to do it.  We should consider saving all of the present archive directories somewhere, too, so that retrieval from old Maxc tapes will not be so bad.  I think it will place a burden on people to try to predict in advance which of they're archived files they're going to want.4. <GAMES>WUMPUS.

I really like to keep my on-line storage low -- primarily to keep the directories small.  Even a reasonably inconvenient archiving system that preserved subdirectories would make it more likely that people could clean up large project directories.  Without it, there is a strong tendency to want to use IFS as an archival storage medium.  I know of no good alternative.Let's make sure we use up the next available summer student type to work on this kind of thing, if we can't find any other way to do it.  Even if Alpine succeeds in taking up the load pretty soon, I suspect an IFS archival scheme would remain valuable for some time to come. *start*01179 00024 US Date: Mon, 29 Aug 83 11:54 PDTFrom: Fikes.paSubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: "Taft's message of Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDT"To: Taft, RWeavercc: FikesI was out of town last week and just read your message regarding the planned demise of Maxc.  I have two types of reactions:  one as a personal Maxc user and second as an IFS administrator.As a personal Maxc user, I regularly use Maxc via DLS from my terminal at home.  The primary use is writing and editing documents (via SOS), although I also use LISP from home.  I also regularly use the "calendar" program on Maxc (from my D machine at work and from home) to maintain my daily calendar.  It is very crude but has sufficient functionality and ease of access to make it worthwhile for me.  So, losing Maxc will significantly effect the computing facilities that I regularly use.As an IFS administrator, Maxc plays a vital role as PARC's archive server.  What plans to you have for providing or coordinating the development of a replacement archive facility?  Certainly there is a vital need for such facilities and I am not aware of any current alternatives.richard *start*04304 00024 US Date: 29 Aug. 1983 1:20 pm PDT (Monday)From: Winograd.PASubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: Taft's message of Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDTTo: Taft, RWeavercc: Winograd, BrianSmithThe message about MAXC was long-expected, but still raises a lot of questions. Before going into details, I should acknowledge that I am a somewhat specialcase, since I do somewhat equal amounts of work at PARC and at Stanford, so I'mneither an occasional user of PARC systems, nor a fully dedicated one. However, I suspect a lot of people are in somewhat similar situations, and therewill be more through things like the collaboration with the new CSLI atStanford.  I would hate to see a necessary technical change end up having theeffect of making PARC even more isolated from the rest of the academiccomputer science community.  I would encourage the creation of whatever newfacilities are necessary to maintain and strengthen the ties.My current uses of MAXC, which are not easily shiftable are the following:FTP and TELNET:  I often transfer files back and forth to Stanford and othersites.  Your message says: "Arpanet terminal access (Telnet) and file transfer(FTP) will be feasible to implement on top of the ARPA TCP/IP software; butthere are no immediate plans to implement these."  I can't imagine that I am theonly one for whom the lack of an FTP to the rest of the world would be atremendous hindrance to my own work and my communication with others. Telnet is only slightly less critical.  I use it often in both directions (especiallyfor logging in to other ARPANET systems while working at PARC).  I reallydon't think it makes sense to have any interim period without MAXC andwithout a full implementation of these services.Remote mail reading:  I often log in from home or from Stanford to read my mailhere.  In order to do this, I have kept my Mailbox on MAXC.  Presumably Icould come in over the DLS or ARPANET (assuming TELNET and theappropriate CHAT connectivity) and log in to a mail server (is that possible?) butthe mail reading programs available there are pretty primitive.  There must beothers who at least log in from home.Archiving:  You discuss the problem of getting back old archived files, but whatabout archiving new ones?  I currently have files on IVY that could well bearchived, but haven't been because of the difficulties (e.g. file name formatincompatabilities).  Without some kind of easily accessible archive facilities, wewill just need to keep buying disc drives.   As an example of my needs, I havethe source files for an entire book which are archived and which will not beneeded for a few years, but which will then have to be retrievable to work on asecond edition.  I currently do not have anywhere near enough room on IFSs (inspite of very large allocations) to store all of the things I have archived that Iwouldn't want to lose.  I suggest that in addition to providing a new archivefacility, you offer a one time direct archive-to-archive transfer for files peopleselect from what is currently in the MAXC archives.  Of course, people can beasked to use their own private tape libraries instead of a common archivefacility, but that seems like a step backwards, and will cetainly encourage theovercrowding of the file servers.TEX:  A Cedar TEX will be fine, if it can be installed as a server.  Since I (andmany others) have machines (e.g., ALTO II) that do not run Cedar or do nothave it installed, it would be a large inconvenience to have to go make use of aCSL Pool Dorado if TEXing is part of the regular cycle of document prepration(edit, TEX, look at the result, iterate..).  It would also presumably add to thedemand by outsiders on CSL Cedar Dorados.HARDCOPY:  The HARDCOPY program on MAXC is the only one I know of thattakes a BRAVO file and produces an acceptable ASCII substitute.  Is theresomething else that runs on an ALTO or could be installed as a server?.  I knowthat for part of the world, BRAVO will be replaced by CEDAR-based systems,but that part of the world is not the full MAXC user set.  I may come up with more later, but that is the major part.  Thanks for yourefforts to keep the system as useful and convenient as it has been.--t*start*01435 00024 US Date: Mon, 29 Aug 83 19:53 PDTFrom: AHenderson.PASubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: "Taft's message of Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDT"To: Taft, RWeavercc: AHendersonEd:Just got back from vacation and some conferences.

According to Alan Bell, the former MPC czar, the mailbox remained on MAXC for three reasons:a)It enabled previewing the messagesb)It was an independent backup, if the MPC message parsing program failed for some reason.c)It would have meant modifying the code of the above program to account for the difference in protocols between MAXC and Grapevine.a) & b) are nice, but unnecessary. We need to know the new protocols so we can modify our software to fit in with Grapevine; it presently uses the MTP protocol.2) Tape Reading.  I have used the MAXC programs TAPUT and EBCDIC to read VLSI projects submitted in tape form. MPC does write its own tapes, independent of MAXC, and I'm sure I could modify the program to read tapes.

We could use it for a number of purposes:a) ARPANET services	TCP/IP implementations for VAX/UNIX are available and relatively	complete and reliable. This would give us File transfer, Telnet access	from DLS and a variety of other Arpanet services which would otherwise	not be available without a great deal of software development. b) MAG-tape services	A number of users at PARC and elsewhere occasionally need to interchange	mag-tapes with other sites. A number of such utility programs are available	for VAX/UNIX.c) Ability to run at PARC software generated at other universities	I believe that a majority of universities doing computer science research	(and ARPA sites) are using VAX/UNIX for their software development.	One of the original reasons for having Maxc was to be able to occasionally	use such software at PARC. (For example, CLU runs on VAX/UNIX,	as do a number of VLSI tools, etc.) Those are the benefits. The costs:a) TCP/IP software exists already for VAX/UNIX, and is presumably low in cost.   PUP and NS software for both 10 MB and 3MB Ethernet hardware.b) I believe that a VAX 750 can be acquired for prices starting at $50K. A more serious configuration(e.g., a 780 with 600 MB disk, large memory, tape drives, ethernet) would probably run closer to $300K.c) Hardware maintenance could be bought from DEC. DEC is beginning to supply UNIX as well, although getting from Berkeley would probably not be hard, given the ties with Berkeley.d) There was some talk of the CLSI (?) acquiring a VAX at PARC. The source of funding, ownership, and timing may not fit well with the plans for replacing MAXC, however. If it did work out, it might be possible to share costs between the various users.*start*00854 00024 US Date:  9-Sep-83 14:12:51 PDT (Friday)From: Malasky.PASubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: Taft's message of Sun, 21 Aug 83 10:53 PDTTo: Taft, RWeavercc: MalaskyI'm not sure how interested you are in this, but one of the things we had to do for the Expert product was to add a way to write mag tapes.

An urgent personal matter has developedwhich will require that I leave work at 10:00 this morning.  I will not be ableto make the 11:30 meeting to discuss Maxc decommissioning.  I don't think myabsense will detract much since I would probably only listen and take notes.	The main value of my presense would be to relay information regarding the VAX.  At the moment the situation can be described as rather bleak.  Thereis a problem with the tape drive which causes the system to hang for varyinglengths of time ranging from several minutes to infinity (until a switch is turnedoff on the tape controller or the system is rebooted).  DEC has been unable todetermine the cause of the problem, and is nearly ready to replace the entiredrive (according to the frustrated tech. rep.).  The drive also has developed arun-away problem.  I have brought the problem of the Archive malfunctionto the attention of the GSL folks and the consulting expert but have yet toreceive a reply.  Most GSL VAX users that wish to archive their files also havea Maxc account and use Maxc's Archive facility.	I am attaching to a hard copy of this message and leaving it on your desk theVAX Archive Procedures which was written by Jim Bratnober in February of 1980.At that time it worked well with the then current version 2 of VMS.  As far as Ican tell the Archive and Retrieval system hasn't worked since verson 3 wasimplemented.

The Lisp group (which I assume means some combination of CIS and XSIS) is very interested in acquiring a VAX running Unix.  I have talked with Larry Masinter and Jon L. White about this, and also with a Unix wizard from Berkeley named Eric Cooper who works as a consultant (I don't know to which organization).  If this works out, it could solve our Arpanet FTP/Telnet access problem; and it would be vastly preferable to using GSL's VAX because CIS/XSIS have system software expertise whereas GSL does not.(By the way, this VAX acquisition seems to be entirely separate from any machine acquisitions that might be made by the recently-established CSLI -- though there might be some potential for a cooperative effort.)I suggest that now is perhaps a good time to do some negotiation at the next level up.2. The archiving situation seems pretty hopeless.  The GSL VAX archive system is presently not working; their system support consultant is being terminated; they hope to hire someone full time but don't yet have any definite plans; and I suspect there would be serious operational problems such as VMS restrictions on file name length.Surprising as it may seem, the situation with Unix is even worse.  According to Eric Cooper, there simply does not exist a Tenex-style archive system (selective archiving and retrieval with on-line directory).So I think we are left with the need to roll our own archive system.  Butler's scheme seems like the least amount of work, though I would propose one addition: also keep some permanent log of archived files so that an on-line directory could be constructed at some future time (perhaps by someone interested in another Cedar data base application).Unless there are objections, I will go ahead and advertise for a Cedar programmer to implement this.	Ed*start*04450 00024 US Date: Saturday, 22 October 1983, 18:03-PDTFrom: dekleer.PASubject: Planning for the demise of MaxcTo: Taft.PA, RWeaver.PACc: Brown, dekleerYour msg arrived while I was on vacation and the fact the MAXC would begoing away so flabergasted and depressed me (seriously) that I kept onprocrastinatng sending this msg. I had lunch with Fiala the other dayand that triggered me into sending this msg.  To put it briefly: IREALLY REALLY wish MAXC could stay (in fact I refuse to believe it'sgoing away, I forsee wasting months of my effort making up for itsdemise)).  Also getting rid of our PDP-10 puts that much distancebetween us and the rest of the world.  Getting rid of MAXC will onlyexcacerbate the provincial attitude PARC has to the rest of thecomputing science world.  Now all of our machines are of the home-grownvariety and we will only be able to run programs written here.  Whatabout things produced in the rest of the world?  How can we try outsomeone's new mumblyfratz (e.g., a new PROLOG).  We won't be able to runanyone else's software.  Other people can write interesting programstoo.  Admittedly, the PDP-10 is at the end of its days, but it still isthe most `universal' of machines.  There are piles of software existingon PDP-10, most of which does not run on Xerox machines.  I'm going tohave a hard time enumerating them all--probably I will discover most ofthem empirically after MAXC is gone.  If MAXC is unmaintainable whydon't we get a cheap FOONLY??  It's this sort of rationale thatcontributed to MIT decided to buy their latest 10.  The absolutely leastthing we should do is prepare to rent time/space on someone else'sPDP-10.  I here rumours someone is thinking about getting a VAX toreplace MAXC, if you are thinking of doing that why not buy a FOONLY.Here are some of my gripes (admittedly some are self-serving but itillustrates the pain-in-the butt getting rid of MAXC is going to be forme).The only decent text preparation system available here is TEX.  All mypapers are written in TEX.  I hope a TEX server gets built.  Bestsolution, have a server I can chat to run TEX and interact with it as onTENEX.  E.g., \input phylum:<dekleer>core.tex.  If some solution to thisisn't found I am going to be fundamentally shafted.  I use the archive system heavily.  If its going to be hard to retrievefiles from the archive tapes, I'm shafted.  I regulary copy files fromIFS's->MAXC for archive.  What should happen is an archive system forIFS's in which previously archived TENEX files automatically appear.Being paranoid I'm starting to go through my archive directory andretrieving those files I can't afford to be without and copying them tophylum.  (A further `waste' of my time and good space.)How am going to run a MACLISP or INTERLISP-10 program?  I can't do itwithout moving it to Lisp machines which often involves a lot more effortthan commonly advertised.Editors.  Losing EMACS and its associated utilities is a disaster.  Itsby far the most powerful editor we have here, and we won't be able torun it anymore.  Its the only editor that works over phone lines here.I am used to editting papers at home.  I do this by dialing in andrunning EMACS on MAXC.  What now?I am used to reading mail at home with the identical system I use atwork.  Reading and answering mail at home will become impossible.  (Thatdial in server on Ernestine is quite frankly a piece of junk compared toBABYL).TECO is the only editor that can hack truely huge files (i.e., 1000s ofpages).  Sure there is a mag tape server, but what about all the relatedsoftware?  Reading and playing with tapes is going to be much harder.  Iused to be able to run TAPUT/DUMPER on MAXC to put the stuff in TENEXfiles and then copy these files to phylum.All good PROLOGs run on the 10.  How can we play around with PROLOG?If I read your msg right, there is going to be no plans to implementARPANET ftp and telnet.  What!?  Suppose I want to run some program atMIT, or transfer files.  FTP can be partially accomplished by sendinghumongous msgs (but msgs bigger than 10K chars get squashed).  How can Icopy binary files.  I'll have to go back to shipping tapes back andforth --- and there is doubt that is even going to work if all thereis going to be is a tape server protocol.So, you see I wish that MAXC's demise be delayed as much as possible.-------*start*01179 00024 US Date: Mon, 24 Oct 83 10:23 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Re: Planning for the demise of MaxcIn-reply-to: "dekleer's message of Saturday, 22 October 1983, 18:03-PDT"To: dekleercc: Taft, RWeaver, BrownThanks for your message.  As you might expect, I've gotten quite a lot of feedback already on my message about Maxc; that was my intention in wording it the way I did.There have already been some substantial changes in plans.  Briefly:  1) We are building a new archive system that is independent of Maxc.  It will be able to archive files from IFS and other servers that support FTP.  2) Maxc will not be shut down until some alternative arrangement has been made for Arpanet FTP and Telnet access.  There are several possibilities now under investigation (e.g., item 3).  3) There are efforts afoot in CIS and XSIS to acquire a VAX.  If this happens, many of the popular time-sharing services (e.g., Emacs, TEX) will be available.It's to be expected that decommissioning Maxc will entail some inconvenience.  But we must weigh this against the costs of continuing to operate a system that uses obsolete hardware and unsupported software.	Ed*start*01678 00024 US Date: Mon, 24 Oct 83 12:13 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Maxc decommissioning and CIS/XSIS VAXTo: Schroedercc: TaftMike,Among the major services now provided by Maxc, the only one that we (CSL) have not made plans to replace is FTP/Telnet access to the Arpanet.  This service is sufficiently important to many users that I consider its replacement to be a prerequisite to decommissioning Maxc.I've had discussions with several people in CIS and XSIS about this, primarily with Larry Masinter and Jon L. White.  They have told me that both organizations have considerable interest in acquiring a VAX.  I understand that this machine would be used by CIS to run software they would like to import, and by XSIS to enable better support to many of their customers who have VAXes.If these plans work out within the correct time frame (say, by the end of the first quarter of 1984), the VAX could be used to provide the Maxc replacement service for Arpanet FTP/Telnet access.  I've also talked with Eric Cooper, a Berkeley Unix wizard who consults for XSIS; he assures me that there would be no technical problems with this approach.Providing this service on a VAX operated by CIS and XSIS would be vastly preferable to using the GSL VAX for this purpose, in my estimation.  There are several reasons for this, chief among which is the fact that CIS and XSIS have considerable systems programming expertise whereas GSL has none at all.At this time, I am requesting you to take up this topic at the appropriate levels of management, particularly to find out how real these VAX plans are and when they are likely to be put into effect.  Thanks.	Ed*start*00433 00024 US Date: Fri, 30 Dec 83 14:40 PSTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Re: Maxc Sort programIn-reply-to: "RWeaver's message of 28 Dec 83 09:22:29 PST"To: RWeavercc: Taft, MannesThere are no plans to implement a replacement for the Maxc Sort program.

The first 4 bytes contain the leftmost 32 bits of a Maxc word; then there is a byte of garbage; and finally there is a byte containing the rightmost 4 bits of the Maxc word followed by the 4 "tag" bits, which you should ignore.Hereafter, whenever I say "word" I mean 36-bit PDP-10 word as interpreted above. The notation a,,b means a in the left 18 bits and b in the right.The remaining information is gleaned by reading the BSYS listings. I do not certify it as being 100% accurate, but it should be close enough to permit figuring out the truth after examining an existing archive tape or two.A file on the tape (including the directory file at the beginning) consists of a header block followed by some number of data blocks. Each block (both header and data, but not including the directory's header block) has the following structure:  Block number (1 word). All the blocks on the tape are sequence numbered starting at zero. File marks don't count as blocks in this numbering.  file,,page number (1 word). All the files on the tape are sequence numbered starting at zero, and each block of a file has the same file number. The page number is the logical location of the page within the file, starting at zero. Page numbers are in ascending order, but they are not necessarily sequential since Tenex files can have "holes" (missing pages) in them. Such files are relatively rare, but there is one case you will not be able to avoid: the directory file is full of holes. The header block at the beginning of a file has a page number of 777775B.  data (512 words)  page protection (1 word). I suggest you ignore this information!515 words total.A file's header block has the following information in its data field:  FDB (File Descriptor Block, 21 words). This is given below.  Name string block (variable). String block format is given below.  Extension string block (variable)  Account string block if any (variable). I doubt you will care about "accounts" in the Tenex sense.  Padding (variable, to fill out 64 words)  Directory number (1 word, located at word 64 of the data field). I don't believe directory numbers are of any interest to you.  Directory name string block (variable).The following stuff in the FDB may be of interest. I'm omitting information that I don't think is useful; the complete truth may be found on page 7 of the BSYSDF listing, or page 2-63 of the Tenex JSYS manual.  Word 1: garbage ,, pointer to name string. A "pointer" here is an offset relative to the start of the data field.  Word 2: pointer to extension string ,, garbage  Word 4: file protection  Word 7: version number ,, garbage  Word 9: bits 6-11: byte size            right half (bits 18-35): number of pages in file. This can differ from the page number of the last page plus one if the file has holes.  Word 10: Length of file in bytes (of the byte size given in word 9). Tenex files of any byte size have bytes packed left-to-right in each word, with any leftover bits at the right thrown away. That is, a 7-bit file (which is standard for ASCII text) packs 5 bytes per word with one bit wasted.  Word 11: File creation time. Time in Tenex is measured from midnight, November 18, 1858, GMT. The number of days is in the left 18 bits and the number of additional seconds is in the right 18 bits. To translate this to a "Pup time", take the left half, subtract 15385, multiply by 86400, and add the right half. Then, to turn this into a BasicTime.GMT, call BasicTime.FromPupTime.String block format:  Word 0: garbage ,, size of block in words (including this word)  Words 1 through n-1: 7-bit ASCII text string, padded with at least one zero byte at the end.A file name is broken into four pieces: directory, name, extension, and version. The directory, name, and extension are stored as separate strings, and the version is stored as an integer. The punctuating characters "< > . ;" are not included in any of the strings, but must be supplied by the software that reconstructs the file name from the separate components.I believe this is everything you need to know about all files on the tape except the directory. I'll go into directory format in a separate message. I suggest you preserve this information as comments somewhere in the source files for your software.	Ed*start*03928 00024 US Date: Fri, 20 Jan 84 10:48 PSTFrom: Taft.PASubject: BSYS tape directory formatTo: Diebertcc: TaftThe tape directory consists of a header, which is NOT in the standard header format, followed by exactly 200 data pages containing the directory, followed by a file mark, followed by 18 inches of blank tape. When the directory is rewritten, it is followed by only 9 inches of blank tape. This is to assure that when it stops writing there is blank tape underneath, so there are no glitches.The header block is 64 words long. I think the only interesting piece of information is the tape number, which is in word 1. (The complete definition of a tape header is on page 10 of BSYSDF.)The directory is an ordinary file, as described in my previous message. But there are two unusual things about it: (1) it has lots of "holes", and (2) there are some number of unused pages at the end (to fill up the 200 pages), marked with a file,,page number word of all ones.The directory file is organized as some number of "user directories", each of which is up to 16 pages long and starts at a 16-page boundary. Each directory has a "directory number" in [0..1023]; directory number n starts at page 16*n in the file. Most directories use fewer than 16 pages. The directory file contains only those pages that are actually used, which is why it has lots of holes.Each "user directory" is considered as an independent data structure; that is, you have to look at all 16 (or fewer) pages at once. It's full of pointers, which are all relative to word zero of page zero of that user directory. Directory number zero is special and will be described later.A user directory consists of three regions, in this order: a fixed region, a variable region, and a symbol table. The fixed region starts at word 0 of the directory. The only things in it that I think you will find useful are:  Word 3: pointer to first word of symbol table  Word 4: pointer to first word beyond end of symbol tableThe symbol table is shoved up against the end of the last page actually used in the user directory. The variable region is where all the name strings, FDBs (file descriptor blocks), and other stuff are located.The symbol table is an array of one-word entries, each of which contains a pointer to a name string in the left half and a pointer to an FDB in the right half. This table is sorted by name. I should mention at this point that all name strings in Tenex are stored literally and that all characters except null are legal; upper and lower case are NOT equivalent. Lower case letters are usually converted to upper case as they are typed in, so you will find that nearly all stored file names are entirely upper case.The string block format and FDB format were given in my previous message. The FDB pointer gets you to an FDB for SOME file with that name; you find the actual extension and version by looking at the left half of word 2 and the left half of word 7 respectively. Starting at this FDB, there are chains of other FDBs for files with the same name but different extension or version or both. Specifically, the right half of word 2, if nonzero, points to another FDB with the same name but different extension. The right half of word 7, if nonzero, points to another FDB with the same name and extension but a different version. The FDBs along a version chain are in descending order of version number.That is everything you need to know about ordinary user directories. Directory number zero is special: it contains a symbol table that maps directory names to directory numbers. Words 3 and 4 describe the symbol table as described above. Each symbol table entry has a pointer to a directory name string in the left half and a directory number in the right half. Once you have the directory number, you multiply it by 16 to get the page number of the first page of the user directory.	Ed*start*01091 00024 US Date: Sun, 22 Jan 84 11:19 PSTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Addendum to BSYS tape directory formatTo: Diebertcc: TaftNormally, when an error is detected during writing, the conventional error retry mechanism is invoked: erase the block and write a new one further along the tape, leaving a larger-than-usual gap.However, if an error is detected while writing the directory, doing that is not acceptable, since BSYS would no longer have good control over the exact amount of tape consumed. Instead, BSYS leaves the bad block as it stands and simply writes another copy in the next block. Of course, it later compensates for this by writing one fewer dummy blocks at the end to fill out the standard 200-page file.This means that when reading the directory, you may find more than one copy of a page in consecutive blocks, and the first page may or may not be readable. When you detect a read error while reading a directory page, try reading the next one. If it has the correct block number then it is a copy of the unreadable page, which you can then ignore.	Ed
