Updating the Arpanet Host Name Tablex3e36\b43B	The Arpanet host name table is distributed periodically and has to be retrieved and installed manually on Maxc.  The person who maintains the table sends a message (see below) whenever he makes a change (typically once every 2-3 weeks).	e12jSample messagee12j- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -	Mail-from: Arpanet host SRI-CSL rcvd at 12-JUL-81 0953-PDT	Date: 12 Jul 1981 0918-PDT	Sender: GEOFF at SRI-CSL	Subject: New Host Table Available (;316).	From: the tty of Geoffrey S.

Changing PARC-GUEST Passwordx3e36\b35BAt the beginning of each month the <PARC-GUEST> password should be changed and the file <DOC>PARC-GUEST.PASSWORD should be edited to show the new password.  (Hint: Version number of file <DOC>PARC-GUEST.PASSWORD corresponds to month.)	 x3e12j\157f1i77f0I20.4.
