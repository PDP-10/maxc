CREATING AND DESTROYING MAXC ACCOUNTSy716x3e12c(635)\b42B19.1.  Obtaining a Maxc Accountx3e36\b31BMaxc directories are requested via a directory-request form obtainable from [Ivy]<Forms> directory.  The following forms are available:	x3e12jMaxcFilesOnly.Press (Figure 7, Appendix)	This form requests the creation of a Files-Only directory.PARegistryAppl.Press (Figure 8, Appendix)	This form requests the creation of a Grapevine, Ivy or Maxc account.	It is for CSL, SDD, SCA and other PARC employees only.MaxcNon-XeroxLogin.Press (Figure 9, Appendix)	This form requests a Maxc login account for Non-Xerox employees or	Xerox employees not at PARC or Palo Alto SDD.l5080x3e12\21b10i8BI84b10i8BI154b10i8BIThe top part of a directory application is filled out by the applicant and his supervisor.  The form then migrates to Ron Cude (SDD), Larry Masinter or Alan Bell (SCA), or Ron Weaver (other) who does the following:	x3e12jVerifies that the directory name is not in conflict with an existing directory and that the password is reasonably unguessable;l3969x3e12Approves the directory request and fills in the desired directory parameters on the form;l3969x3e12Ordinarily the account administrators forward the form to Ron Weaver who authorizes and creates the account, then passes the form on  to Kathi Anderson, who is in charge of maintaining the Maxc account file.  On rare occasions it may be necessary (because of time restraints) for an administrator to create an account.  On such occasions the administrator is asked to notify Ron Weaver of such creation and to make certain that all files specified in section 19.4.2 are correctly edited.	.x3e12jThe various steps in creating a Maxc directory are discussed below.  After the directory is created, the application form goes to Kathi Anderson who adds the name to appropriate distribution lists, notifies Lynn Harrington for updating the phone list, then files the form.	x3e12j19.2.  General Information About Maxc Directoriesx3e36\b49BPasswordsx3e12\i9IInitial passwords are required to be unpronounceable and relatively unguessable.  However, there is nothing to prevent the user from changing his password later, so we can't guarantee this.  We do not permit passwords for "regular" directories (as opposed to message-only directories) to be known to more than one person; this guards the system against unauthorized access.	x3e12jUpper and lower case characters are equivalent for passwords, so it is not necessary to be careful about case while entering passwords.	x3e12jUser groups and Directory groupsx3e12\i32ITenex file and directory protection distinguishes between three classes of access:	x3e12jself (someone logged into or connected to the directory);same group (someone logged into a directory in the same group);others.l5080x3e12Putting a user's login directory into a User Group allows him to access other directories in that group in the same group mode.	x3e12j\111i10IPutting a directory into a Directory Group allows other users in that group access in the same group mode.x3e12j\90i10IDirectories are usually setup so that new files created in that directory will permit total owner access, read-only same-group access, and no access to others.  Most new directories are assigned to the Computer-research user group and directory group.  There are many exceptions.	x3e12jA list of the current groups is supposed to be kept in <ACCOUNTS>GROUP-LIST.NUMBERS and was as follows on 4 October 1979:	x3e12j0	Computer-research	13	Pogos1	System	14	Nova2	Mesa	15	PARC3	Secretaries	16	XMS-users4	Lisp	17	User-Sciences5	Understander	18	ITG6	Bliss	19	Mesa-users7	Inter-Network	20	Reyes8	Customer Programming	21	SSL Group Leaders and Secretaries9	University MPC	22	JDS10	Alto	23	University Grant11	Parcpub	24	CSL12	Graphicsl3969x3e12(0,4763)(1,9843)(2,10636)Most Xerox user directories are put in the Computer-research directory and in no other groups.	x3e12j(635)File Protectionx3e12\i15IThe file protection assigned a directory is the default protection of new files created in that directory.  The file protection is an 18-bit number divided into three 6-bit groups.  This number breaks down into three fields, identical in format, each of which can be regarded as containing two octal digits or six binary bits.  The first 6-bits define owner protection, second same-group protection, and third general-public protection.  The interpretation of the bits in a group is as follows:x3e12jB0	Read contents of fileB1	Write onto fileB2	Execute program stored in fileB3	Append to fileB4	Access per page tableB5	--l5080x3e12k40Setting a bit to 1 permits the action; setting it 0 denies the action.  Taking these six bits as a two digit octal number, some common values are:  77, which permits full access; 52, which protects a file from modification but permits other functions; and 00, which denies everything.  [Refer to Figure 6, Appendix for correct values corresponding to boxes on Files-only account request form.]	x3e12j\296b10i8B1IDirectory Protectionx3e12\i20IIn addition to specifying the access allowed to file contents, Tenex allows directory contents to be protected similarly.  The directory protection word is composed of three 6-bit fields, one field each for "self", "group", and "others" similar to the file protection word.  The bits have meaning as follows:x3e12jB0	If off, completely prevents use of the directory in any wayB1	Files may be opened subject to file protectionB2	Owner functions permitted (including CONNECT) without passwordB3	Files may be added to the directoryB4	--B5	--l5080x3e12Directory protection can only be changed by someone with WHEEL status.  Some common values of Directory protection are:  776060, which permits the owner to do everything, other users to read-write files according to file protection; 777760 permits the owner and same group to do everything, others to read-write according to protection (typically used for files-only directories); 777700 permits owner and same group everything, general public nothing (typically used for files-only directories that one doesn't want non-group people to see); 777060 permits owner everything, same group connect access (typically used for files-only directories in the Computer-research group, where you want everyone to be able to connect but not to be able inadvertently to clobber files while not connected).  [Refer to Figure 6, Appendix for correct values corresponding to boxes on Files-only account request form.]	x3e12j\806b10i8B1IDisk Limitx3e12\i10IPresently, message-only directories are assigned a disk limit of 50 which is enforced.x3e12Regular directories are assigned a disk limit that varies according to the organization:  CSL, 1000 pages; SCA, 750 pages; SDD, ASM, and other, 250 pages.  This varies when special needs are present.  Disk limits for regular directories are not "enforced", which means that file storage in these directories can exceed allocation without difficulties (except an annoying "over allocation" message from Tenex) until total free storage in the system falls below 2000 disk pages.  When free storage is below this, attempts to write new files into directories over allocation are denied.	x3e12jProject Groupx3e12k40\i13IThe project group to which a directory is assigned classifies it for the accounting software, which summarizes CPU utilization, file storage use, etc. according to these groups.	x3e12jThe current project groups are ADL, Administration, Administration-not-on-phone-list, AMDS/NY, ASM/ES, ASM/PA, ASM/Rank-Xerox-Sweden, Computer-Research, CSL, CSL-Consultants, CSL-Files-only, CSL-Summer, CSL-Temporary, CSL-University-Grant, CSL-Visiting-Scientist, ED/LA, EES, EES-Files-Only, EOS/Pasadena, GSL, ICL, ICL-Consultants, ISL, ISL-Consultants, ISL-Files-Only, ISL-Summer, JDS, Legal, Lisp-Files-Only, Non-Xerox, Old-NonPARC, OSL, OSL-Consultants, PARC, PARC-Files-Only, PD/LA, PSD/ES, SCA-B32-CIS, SCA-B32-CIS-Consultants, SCA-B32-CIS-Files-Only, SCA-B32-CIS-Summer, SCA-B32-LRG, SCA-B32-LRG-Consultants, SCA-B32-LRG-Files-Only, SCA-B32-LRG-Summer, SCA-B35-VLSI, SCA-B35-VLSI-Consultants, SCA-B35-VLSI-Files-Only, SCA-B35-VLSI-Summer, SCA-Unknown, SDD, SDD-Files-Only, SDD/LA, SDD-Mesa, Shugart, Tenex, Undesignated-Summer-Students, Versatec, Webster, XCS/LA and Xerox.  Directories are attached to these projects by editing the <ACCOUNTS>PROJECTLIST file.	x3e12jk40The  PROJECTLIST file is used by the MAXC-ACCT subsystem discussed later.  It is important that this file be updated correctly, but Tenex will run correctly even when this file is invalid or incomplete.x3e12jThe format of a group in the PROJECTLIST file is as follows:x3e12CSL:AIS, ALISP, ..., WINOGRAD, YEARY;l5080x3e12i.e., the group name followed by a ":", the list of directory names in alphabetical order separated by "," and terminated by ";".	x3e12jFiles-only Directoriesx3e12\i22IFiles-only directories are created when needed, usually to hold files needed by a number of different users working on a common project.  Tenex does not allow login to files-only directories.  Each files-only directory is represented by a line in the <SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT file of the form:	x3e12jOWNER,FILEDIRECTORYl5080x3e12where OWNER is the login directory name of the person responsible for FILEDIRECTORY.  <SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT is needed by the archive system to direct messages about archive traffic to OWNER.  By convention, the entries in ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT are in alphabetical order by owner, and where there are several files-only directories for a single owner, these are also in alphabetical order.	x3e12j<SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT is also used by the HOGS program, discussed below, to associate disk usage of files-only directories with the login account for the person responsible for the storage.x3e12jFor ease of looking up the owner of a Files-Only directory I have created the file <SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY-ALPHA.TXT which list directories alphabetically in the formx3e12jFILEDIRECTORY,OWNERl5080x3e12Login Directoriesy730x3e12\i17IEach login directory is represented by a line in the file <ACCOUNTS>UACHK.TXT.  The standard entry in this file is as follows:	x3e12jACCOUNTANT:1*,BACKGROUNDl5080x3e12This line controls the pie slice scheduling groups accessible to the directory.  The "1*" means that the default login pie slice is the numerically named account number 1; the ",BACKGROUND" means that after login, the user can change his pie slice to the low priority BACKGROUND slice.x3e12jk40Nearly all directories are represented by a UACHK.TXT entry in the above format.  However, a few directories for people who maintain the hardware or do other special stuff, may be allowed to access some other slices.  For example:	x3e12jSYSTEM:1*,BACKGROUND,SERVICE,MAINT,ARPANET,220100l5080x3e12This allows the <SYSTEM> directory to change its scheduling slice to BACKGROUND, SERVICE, MAINT, ARPANET, or 220100.	x3e12jThe UACHK.TXT file is compiled into a big accounting matrix which is stored on <SYSTEM>UACHK.FILE during the procedure for creating or destroying directories.	x3e12jMessage Userx3e12\i12IMessage-only users have very limited access to subsystems and have enforced disk limits.  The subsystems accessible to message-only users are specified in <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.directory-name, if it exists, or in <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.DEFAULT, if no special file exists for the directory.  It is required that subsystem names in these files be in alphabetical order.  <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.DEFAULT presently contains the following:x3e12j<PUP>EFTP.SAV<SUBSYS>ARCVER.SAV<SUBSYS>DELVER.SAV<SUBSYS>MSG.SAV<SUBSYS>PLZFIX.SAV<SUBSYS>PRESS.SAV<SUBSYS>READMAIL.SAV<SUBSYS>SEE.SAV<SUBSYS>SNDMSG.SAV<SUBSYS>XMS.SAVl5080x3e12If a special <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.directoryname file is created for a message-only directory, it will generally contain all of these files plus the extra ones that are added for the directory.	x3e12j19.3.  The EcCREATE and EcPRINT Commandsx3e36\b12o4 1o0 12o4 1o0 14BDirectories are created and destroyed using the Tenex Executive's EcCREATE command (i.e., <control-E>CREATE), which has subcommands that allow properties of the directory to bex3e12j\67o4 1o0specified.  The various subcommands for EcCREATE are discussed here, and then examples where directories are actually created and destroyed are given in the following sections.  The current properties of any directory can be observed by using the EcPRINT command.  User encrypted password is printed out as two octal numbers by using the "verbose" form of the ^E Print command (that is, "^EPrint dirName Verbose").  You must have enabled your WHEEL or OPERATOR status to execute CREATE or PRINT.	y715x3e12j\41o4 1o0 206o4 1o0CREATE and its subcommands:x3e12j!EcCREATE username [NEW] (password) password,<cr> [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>l3969x3e12k40\2o4 1o0The default parameters of a new directory are as follows:l5080x3e12DISK limit = 750 pages (not enforced)DEFAULT file protection = 775200PROTECTION of directory = 776060USER group number = 0 (Computer-Research)DIRECTORY group number = 0 (Computer-Research)NUMBER of directory = next unused numberno special capabilitiesdoes not have a mailbox (i.e., has no MESSAGE.TXT file)l6033x3e12If the directory is not supposed to be in the Computer-Research user group or directory group, you will have to remove it from this group using the NOT DIRECTORY and/or NOT USER subcommands below.l5080x3e12!!ABORT	= Cc!!NUMBER dirnumber	for setting directory number.

Be sure to do this on both Maxc1 and Maxc2.  Subsequently, new directories you create will re-use directory numbers of directories that once existed but have been deleted.l3969x2e6j\f1 222f0!!DEFAULT<esc> (file) PROTECTION 6-char octal number			 sets the default file	protection for directory	!!DIRECTORY groupnumber	argument is one of the directory group numbers given	earlier--repeat this subcommand for multiple directory	groups!!SECONDARY groupnumber	argument is one of the directory group numbers given	earlier--repeat this subcommand for multiple directory	groups!!USER groupnumber	argument is one of the directory group numbers given	earlier--repeat this command for multiple directory	groups!!DISK limitinpages	sets disk limit	!!ENFORCE	causes disk limit to be enforced	!!PROTECTION<esc> (of directory) dirprotec						 sets directory protection!!LIST	prints the status of the directory as EcPRINT would	do if the CREATE command were terminated now!!MAILBOX1	Permits MESSAGE.TXT file to be created.

Creating a Maxc Directoryx3e36(635)\b32BYou have to be a WHEEL or OPERATOR to create or destroy a Maxc directory, change the password, or do other kinds of directory maintenance.	x3e12j1.  Enable yourself and connect to the ACCOUNTS directory on Maxc2.  Then do a WHO or LD and make sure that none of the other users who diddle with the accounting are at that time also modifying the accounting files.  They would be connected to the ACCOUNTS or SYSTEM directory, if they were doing this.	x3e12j2.  For login and file-access-only directories (as opposed to files-only directories) edit UACHK.TXT to contain the new directory name.  For files-only directories edit <SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY.TXT and <SYSTEM>ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY-ALPHA.TXT to contain the new directory name.  For all directories edit <ACCOUNTS>-PROJECTLIST to contain the directory in the appropriate places.  If you are creating a number of directories, you can do the edits for all of the directories at once, which saves time.	x3e12jFor some message-only directories, additional subsystems will be specified; these will require the creation of a <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.username file which should include the contents of <SYSTEM>SUBSYSTEMS.DEFAULT plus the additional subsystem names.  We follow the convention of preserving alphabetical ordering of the names in each section of these files.	x3e12j3.  EcCREATE the directory on Maxc2 using one of the following examples as a prototype:x3e12\5o4 1o0File-access-only directory:x3e12\i27I!EcCREATE username [NEW] password,<cr>   (Don't omit the ",") [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>!!MESSAGE<cr>	Makes message-only directory!!DISK 50<cr>	Sets the disk limit to 50 pages!!ENFORCE<cr>	Enforce the disk limit!!LIST<cr>	List the properties of the directory and make sure that	all the parameters are setup as desired!!<cr>	Execute the CREATE with properties as setup [CONFIRM]<cr>l3969x3e12(0,10160)\2o4 1o0Files-only account:x3e12(635)\i19I!EcCREATE username [NEW] password,<cr>   (Don't omit the ",") [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>!!FILES<cr>	Makes files-only directoryl3969x3e12(0,10160)\2o4 1o0!!LIST<cr>	List the properties of the directory and make sure that	all the parameters are setup as desiredl3969x3e3k40!!<cr>	Execute the CREATE with properties as setup [CONFIRM]<cr>l3969x3e3k40Regular directory:x3e12(635)\i18I!EcCREATE username [NEW] password,<cr>   (Don't omit the ",") [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>!DISK 1000<cr>	Sets the disk limit to 1000 pages!!LIST<cr>	List the properties of the directory and make sure that	all the parameters are setup as desired!!<cr>	Execute the CREATE with properties as setup [CONFIRM]<cr>l3969x3e12(0,10160)\2o4 1o04.  After creating the directory you should print the parameters of the directory and write down the directory number, which you will need shortly:	x3e12j(635)!EcPRINT username<cr> [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>DISK LIMIT 1000WHEELALPHANUMERIC ACCOUNTSDIRECTORY NUMBER 15	Write down this number for laterDEFAULT FILE PROTECTION 500000775200DIRECTORY PROTECTION 500000776060USER GROUPS: 0, 1DIRECTORY GROUPS: 0, 1l3969x3e12k80(0,10160)\2o4 1o0 110i32I5.  If you are creating a number of directories at once, you should carry out a EcCREATE sequence for each of them at this time.	x3e12j(635)\81o4 1o06.  Next, you have to reinitialize the accounts on Maxc2 as shown below:	x3e12j!RUNFIL UACHK.RUNFIL<cr>	Reads UACHK.TXT and creates UACHK.FILE on	the connected directory (you are still connected to	<ACCOUNTS>) [This step is necessary for message-	only and regular directories but is not needed for	files-only directories.]	l3969x3e12j(0,10160)--Check for any error messages before continuing--l3969x3e12(635)!EcINITIALIZE ACCOUNTS<cr>	Renames UACHK.FILE onto the <SYSTEM>		directory and installs it as the current accounting	matrix [This step is necessary for message-only and	regular directories but is not needed for files-only	directories.]l3969x3e12j(0,10160)\2o4 1o0Note that if you have a number of Maxc directories to create at once, you can insert all the names into the UACHK.TXT, PROJECTLIST, and ARCHIVE-FILES-ONLY during the same editting session.  Then you can EcCREATE all the directories.  Then you do the RUNFIL and INITIALIZE ACCOUNTS of the files just once.x3e12j(635)\204o4 1o019.5.  Editing the Grapevine Data Base	x3e36j\bThe Grapevine data base must be edited to contain the correct directory name and password for all new Maxc accounts.  It must also be edited to delete the directory name for all Maxc accounts that are destroyed.  To do this you should have version 6T15 or later of Laurel so you can run program Maintain, the Grapevine Registration Server Maintenance Program.	x3e12jRun Laurel and bug "Run" in the lower command menue.  Type Maintain<cr> and control will pass to the Grapevine Registration Server Maintenance Program.  A typical session follows:	x3e12jCreating a Mailbox:	l3528x2e12\b19BGrapevine Registration Server Maintenance Program	Version of 16-Mar-81 19:33:19	Login RName.PA . . . ok	GV: Create Individual : Name.pa<cr> with password: password<cr> . . . done- -> Add Mailbox at server: Cabernet.ms<cr> for individual: Name.pa<cr> . . . doneGV: Add Mailbox to server: Zinfandel.ms<cr> for individual: Name.pa<cr> . . . doneGV: Type Entry for R-Name: Name.pa<cr> . . . done, type=individual	Connect-site:Forwarding: null	Mailbox-sites: maxc	GV: Quit [Confirem] Yes	End of Message	l3881x2e12\f1 49f0 1f1 30f0 1f1 31u1U6u1U12ui7I4U16ui8I4U40u15U17i7uI4U16u1U3u2U17u16U17i7uI4U16u1U4u1U17i7uI4U86b1uB1U15u1U2f0b1f1B1i14f0bIDeleting a Mailbox:	l3528x2e12\bGV: Delete Individual: Name.pa<cr> [Confirm] Yes . . . done	- -> Remove All memberships in registry: pa for R-Name: Name.pa<cr>	l3881x2e12\f1 4u1U6u1U11ui7I4U11u1U13f0b1f1B42u2U13ui7I4f0Ub1f1BMail Forwarding:	l3528x2e12j\bGV: Add Mailbox at server: Maxc<cr> for individual: NewName.pa<cr> . . . 3#14#51 . . . doneGV: Remove Mailbox at server: Maxc<cr> from individual: OldName.pa<cr> . . . 3#14#51 . . . doneGV: Add Forwarding to destination: NewName.pa<cr> for individual: OldName.pa<cr> . . . 3#14#51 . . . doneGV:Note:  If NewName is to be forwarded to some location such as @CMU or @USC-ISIBthen this should be included as part of the NewName followed by .ARPAGATEWAY.l3881x2e12\f1 4u1U3u2U17ui4I4U17ui10I4U30u1U6u2U17ui4I4U18ui10I4U30u1U3u2U25ui10I4U17ui10I4U29f0b1B10i7I107i7I13u12U1bType "?" to see available commands.	l3528x2e12\bGV: ?

When used in this way, directory parameters are initially defaulted to the current parameters of the directory, so only those items being changed need be typed as subcommands.	x3e12j\5o4 1o0Note:  It is illegal to change the directory number or the name of the directory in this way.  To do this it is necessary to destroy and recreate the directory and copy files manually.	x3e12jWhen using CREATE in this way you omit typing the password, so that you don't have to be told the password of the directory in order to change its parameters.  For example:	x3e12j!EcCREATE olddirectoryname,<cr>	(Don't omit the ",") [SUPERPASSWORD] GUESS<cr>!!NOT USER 0<cr>	Remove from Computer-research user group!!USER 1<cr>	Add to System group!!NOT DIRECTORY 0<cr>!!DIRECTORY 1<cr>!!PASSWORD xglot1<cr>	Change the password!!<cr> [CONFIRM]<cr>l3969x3e12(0,10160)\2o4 1o0
