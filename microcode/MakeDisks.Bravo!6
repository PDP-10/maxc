For example:j@Press <AltoDocs>Bcpl.Press,<cr>@@Copies= 3<cr>@@Host for printing: Clover<cr>@@<cr>@l4410e12\28f1 4f0 12f1 4f0 28f1 4f0 3f1 4f0will produce 3 copies of the Alto Bcpl Reference Manual and print it on Clover.	A very small stash (e.g. 3 of each) of these documents should be kept on hand so that visitors who want to "pick up" documentation can find it in a standard place in the MAXC room.	j\85i4IjDisks\b5BFour disks ("BcplProg.", "NonProg.", "ProofReader", and "MesaProg.") should be re-made weekly.  They are all variants of the "MakeDisk" procedure described below.	jIn the directions below, there are statements of the form "Use FTP to retrieve the file <alto>xxx".  This is how to proceed.  First be sure you are talking to the Alto Executive (it types > about half way down the screen). Type "FTP" <carriage return>.  When FTP comes up, type "MAXC" <carriage return>.  Now type "RET <space>", followed by the file name, followed by 2 carriage returns.  If FTP returns with a *, all is done fine.  If you have not previously logged in (and specified a MAXC name and password), you may be asked for the name and password; eventually the transfer should be done and the * should appear.  Now you may type another "RE <space>" etc. if you have more files to retrieve, or you may type "Q <carriage return>" to quit FTP.	jThe following steps comprise the "MakeDisk" procedure:Step 0:\56b6BInsert the previous disk of the given type in the Alto and boot. If there is no previous disk of the given type, you may do one of the following:l4269j-- insert any disk that is reasonably current and boot it; see also the comment at step 2.-- boot the operating system over the ethernet by holding down the back-space key and the key immediately to its right while pushing the boot button.  Keep the button and keys depressed until a flecked pattern appears in the cursor.l5539j\f1Step 1:\b6BType "Install" <carriage return> to the executive.  When it asks "Do you want the long installation dialog?", respond "Y".  When it asks "Do you want to ERASE a disk before installing?", respond "Y". When it asks you to "Type the name of a host from which I can get Alto programs:", respond MAXC.  When it asks you to "Type the name of the directory where Alto programs are kept.  If the host is an IFS or MAXC, this should probably be 'ALTO'.  If the host is just another random Alto, type <cr>:", respond 'ALTO'.  If it asks "Do you want to install the system for 2 model 31 disks?", respond "N".  Be sure MAXC is in fact up!	l4269j\f1 4f0 11f1 50f0 43f1 9f0 7f1 13f0 48f1 9f0 6f1 20f0 63f1 7f0 8f1 19f0 182f1 7f0 10f1 10f0 60f1 7f0 7f1 27f0Step 2:\b6BThe message "If you wish to change disks, please do so now.  When the disk is ready, type OK to proceed, A to abort:" should appear. If you had to insert a disk in step 0 because no previous disk existed, now is the time to remove the disk and insert a brand new one obtained from the disk closet in the MAXC back room.  Type "OK" when you are ready.  After a bit, further messages will be printed.l4269j\f1 11f0 106f1 208f0 6f1 68f0Step 3:\b6BThe message "The disk is configured with the multi-version feature disabled." (or some variant of the message) will appear.  Then you are asked "Do you want to change this setting?".  Answer N or Y as indicated in the disk-specific instructions below.  If you responded with Y, you will be prompted "How many versions of files do you normally wish to keep?" Respond either 0 or 2 depending on instructions below.l4269j\f1 11f0 67f1 65f0 41f1 6f0 3f1 2f0 3f1 76f0 2f1 22f0 60f1 15f0 2f1 2f0 3f1 32f0Step 4:\b6BYou will be asked "Do you want to change the error logging address (currently xxxx)?"; respond N.  You will be asked "Do you want to disable parity error detection?"; respond N.  You will be asked "Do you want to disable phantom parity error reporting?"; respond N.  You will be asked "What is your name:"; respond NoName <cr>.  Then you will be asked "Please give your disk a name: "; respond "BcplProg.BFS" "Non-Prog.BFS", "ProofReader.BFS" or "MesaProg.BFS" as appropriate, followed by <cr>.  Then you will be asked "Do you wish to give the disk a password?" ; respond N. After a brief period, FTP should run and retrieve the Executive from MAXC (Note: You will need to supply a login name and password so that MAXC can be accessed.)	l4269j\f1 17f0 68f1 9f0 5f1 17f0 49f1 9f0 5f1 17f0 57f1 9f0 5f1 17f0 23f1 7f0 8f1 29f0 35f1 7f0 68f1 57f0 44f1 9f0 4f1 22f0 4f1 42f0 6f1 64f0 6f1 17f0Step 5:\b6BUse FTP to retrieve [MAXC]<Alto>NewDisk.cm.  Then type "@NewDisk" to the Alto Executive.  FTP should run for a while; eventually the operating system will be installed again, and you will be asked some of the above questions again. (The user names and disk names will be defaulted to those given in Step 4.  You confirm them with <cr>.)  Change one response: answer "N" to "Do you want the long installation dialog?"	l5539j\f1 3f0 5f1 11f0 26f1 9f0 12f1 22f0 6f1 271f0 5f1 2f0The following list gives disk-specific instructions for the current set of Master Disks.  From time to time the list will grow (probably never shrink).  Note that during step 2 in each set of directions below you will need to supply a login name and password so that MAXC can be accessed.  Also, Bravo will be installed by the command file.  At the end of the installation Bravo will do an automatic Quit and a confirming carriage-return, thus continuing the command file.	jProgrammer's Disk.	1.
