Ignore scope probes dangling from pins, but at any other appearance of inoperativeness, give up or get some knowledgeable person to help.x3e12jB.	Make sure the proper disk packs are mounted.  The labels are on the top of the pack.  3-by-5 cards with the currently mounted pack numbers are supposed to be posted on each drive.  Other packs are in a yellow cabinet in the machine room and should also have cards identifying them.x3e12jC.	Turn on the disk units.  Two switches need to be turned on for each unit.  One of them is in back and inside the cabinet and is labelled "AC power on".  It should be turned on first.  (Normally it is left on.)  Then turn on the obvious switch on the front panel.  Two minutes will elapse before the green light goes on.  The read-only switches on the control panel should also be off.1x3e12j\387f1o4 1f0o0D.	Turn on Alto power by pressing in the circuit breaker on the front panel.  Load the disk cartridge labelled "Maxc2" into the disk drive under the Alto and flip the switch to "Run".  Make sure the Alto monitor and the Diablo printer are turned on.	x3e12jE.	Turn on the microprocessor fan, two microprocessor power supplies, and all memory power supply switches in front of Maxc.  (Normally these are left switched on.  The power supplies are turned on and off under program control.)	x3e12jF.	Assuming the Alto disk is loaded with the correct contents, DC power to the Maxc processor and memories may be turned on by this procedure.  (The next section describes loading the Nova disk from tape.)	x3e12j	Boot the Alto and run the Midas subsystem.  With the left mouse button, successively select the menu items "Power On", "Both", and "Do-It".	x3e12j------------------------------1Note that if a unit is selected, the read-only restriction will remain in force until it is deselected.  This is indicated by the read-only light on the panel.  Don't worry if the read-only light remains on, since the unit will be deselected by firmware later on and the read-only light will go off at that time.  However, be sure the read-only switch is in the off position.	y126x2e2\f1 31o4 1o0 23f0i8f1I344f0
