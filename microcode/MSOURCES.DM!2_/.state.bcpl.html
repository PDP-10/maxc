// STATE.BCPL		Save/Restore state of program// E. R. Fiala -- last edited January 20, 1977  11:37 AM// Programs using this package should not call GetFixed until after// StorageInit is called, else it will be impossible to add initialization// code at the end of the program to the free storage pool.  StorageInit// should be called immediately after the Junta (if any).// The program must pass the address of the first static and last static// to StorageInit.  These are obtained from the layout vector which is an// argument to the entry procedure of the program (FirstStatic = Layout!26// and LastStatic = Layout!27).  It seems wasteful to save all the// procedure statics, but this is necessary if the Overlay package is// used, and it is easier to save them all than worry about it.// All storage to be saved is acquired by the GetStorage routine, so the// state of the program consists of its statics (all of which are saved),// its page zero items (explicitly saved by calls on SaveStatics), and the// core between EndStorage at the time BeginSave is called and EndStorage// at the time SaveState is called.// Consecutive calls to GetStorage allocate blocks with decreasing// addresses.  There is no header word associated with a block, so it// is impossible to selectively deallocate blocks acquired by GetStorage.// The current position at which blocks are being obtained is contained// in the static EndStorage.  Hence, if you want to subsequently free// all the blocks back to some point, you have to save the value of// EndStorage at that point and restore later.  If you want to manage// a region selectively, build a zone from a block acquired by// GetStorage and use the standard Alloc package.// After executing an initialization procedure, its code can be added to// the free storage pool by doing Storage = InitProc.// The static StateBlockSize must be defined elsewhere in the program// BeginSave is called to mark the current position in free storage.// All storage acquired after that time and before SaveState is called// will be saved by SaveState, in addition to StateBlock, all of the// program's statics, and all page-zero statics enumerated by calls// to SaveStatics.  There is no provision for enumerating individual// blocks of storage outside the region delimited by BeginSave and// SaveState.// The first call to SaveState passes a stream argument and a program// label argument.  The caller's frame and this label are remembered// for subsequent RestoreState calls.  Later on the program can call// SaveState again without the label argument.  This will preserve// the same items as were preserved in the original call to SaveState,// allowing the program to fire up with different initial information.// RestoreState accepts a stream argument for the file containing// information saved by SaveState.  Its second argument is a flag// which should be true when RestoreState is called during program// initialization.  The program can reinitialize itself during// operation by calling RestoreState with the second argument false.get "state.d"external [// OS	CallSwat; Closes; ReadBlock; WriteBlock	CallersFrame; GotoLabel; Usc// Program	StateBlockSize// Defined here	BeginSave; SaveState; RestoreState	GetStorage; GetEvenStorage; StorageLeft	EndStorage; Storage// Defined here for init only	NoStore; StateBlock; StatePtr]static [ StateBlock; StatePtr; EndStorage; Storage; NoStore ]let GetStorage(Size) = valof[	EndStorage = EndStorage-Size	if Usc(Storage,EndStorage) &lt; 0 then resultis EndStorage	resultis NoStore("Out of storage")]and GetEvenStorage(Size) = (GetStorage(Size+1)+1) &amp; 177776Band StorageLeft() = EndStorage-Storage//Mark the first location to be savedand BeginSave() be StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.End = EndStorageand SaveState(S,Label; numargs NA) be[	if S eq 0 then CallSwat("No stream for SaveState")	if NA ge 2 do		//Delimit region saved &amp; where to resume	[ StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.Ptr = StatePtr	  StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.CF = CallersFrame()	  StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.CL = Label	  StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.Storage = Storage	  StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.First = EndStorage	]	for I = (size State/16) to StatePtr-2 by 2 do  //Get static values	[ StateBlock!(I+1) = rv StateBlock!I ]	WriteBlock(S,StateBlock,StateBlockSize)	WriteBlock(S,StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.FirstS,StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.NStats)	WriteBlock(S,StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.First,		StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.End - StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.First)	Closes(S)]and RestoreState(S,reinitFlag)be[	if S eq 0 then CallSwat("No stream for RestoreState")	ReadBlock(S,StateBlock,StateBlockSize)	if not reinitFlag then	  if EndStorage ne StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.End then		CallSwat("Program or OS incompatible")	ReadBlock(S,StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.FirstS,StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.NStats)	for I = (size State/16) to StatePtr-2 by 2 do	[ rv (StateBlock!I) = StateBlock!(I+1) ]	EndStorage = StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.First	Storage = StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.Storage	StatePtr = StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.Ptr	let WC = StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.End - EndStorage	let N = ReadBlock(S,EndStorage,WC)	if N ne WC then CallSwat("State file clobbered")	Closes(S); GotoLabel(StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.CF,StateBlock&gt;&gt;State.CL,0)]</pre>
